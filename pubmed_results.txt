AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the accuracy of refraction measurements by ClickCheckTM
      compared with the standard practice of subjective refraction at a tertiary level 
      eye hospital. DESIGN: Diagnostic accuracy trial. METHODS: All participants,
      recruited consecutively, underwent auto-refraction (AR) and subjective refraction
      (SR) followed by refraction measurement using ClickCheckTM (CR) by a trained
      research assistant. Eyeglass prescriptions generated using ClickCheckTM and the
      resulting visual acuity (VA) was compared to SR for accuracy. Inter-rater
      reliability and agreement were determined using Intra-class correlation and Bland
      Altman analysis respectively. RESULTS: The 1,079 participants enrolled had a mean
      (SD) age of 39.02 (17.94) years and 56% were women. Overall, 45.3% of the
      participants had refractive error greater than +/-0.5D. The mean (SD) spherical
      corrections were -0.66D (1.85) and -0.89D (2.20) in SR and CR respectively. There
      was high level of agreement between the spherical power measured using SR and CR 
      (ICC: 0.940 (95% CI: 0.933 to 0.947). For the assessment of cylindrical
      correction, there was moderate level of agreement between SR and CR (ICC: 0.493
      (0.100 to 0.715). There was moderate level of agreement between the VA
      measurements performed by using corrections from SR and CR (ICC: 0.577 (95% CI:
      0.521-0.628). The subgroup analysis based on the age categories also showed high 
      level of agreement for spherical corrections between the two approaches (ICC:
      0.900). Bland Altman analysis showed good agreement for spherical corrections
      between SR and CR (Mean difference: 0.224D; 95% LoA: -1.647 D to 2.096 D) without
      evidence of measurement bias. CONCLUSIONS: There was a high level of agreement
      for spherical power measurement between CR and SR. However, improvements are
      needed in order to accurately assess the cylindrical power. Being a portable,
      low-cost and easy-to-use refraction device, ClickCheckTM can be used for first
      level assessment of refractive errors, thereby enhancing the efficiency of
      refractive services, especially in low- and-middle-income countries.

TI  - Mapping the thickness of retinal layers using Spectralis spectral domain optical 
      coherence tomography in Indian eyes.
PG  - 2990-2997
LID - 10.4103/ijo.IJO_81_22 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: This study aimed at establishing the normative data for the thickness of
      macular layers on Spectralis Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography
      (SD-OCT) in healthy Indian eyes and testing the effects of age, gender, central
      corneal thickness (CCT), and intraocular pressure (IOP) on such values. Methods: 
      This cross-sectional study was done on 308 eyes of 159 healthy subjects. OCT
      scans were obtained using the posterior pole asymmetry scan protocol. From the
      thickness map, data were grouped into nine Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopathy
      Study (ETDRS) macular sectors. Correlation between retinal thickness and
      age/IOP/CCT was done using Pearson correlation. Correcting for age as a
      covariate, multivariate regression analysis was done to know which retinal layers
      showed significant differences in thickness between males and females. Results:
      The mean age was 46.06 +/- 13.06 years (range: 20-75 years). Significant central 
      subfield (CSF) thickening with age was noted in retinal nerve fiber layer (RNFL),
      inner nuclear layer (IPL), inner nuclear layer (INL), outer plexiform layer
      (OPL), and outer nuclear layer (ONL) (P < 0.04). The average thickness of the
      outer ring reduced with age in the ganglion cell layer (GCL)/IPL/INL (P = 0.001).
      Women had thinner inner and outer retinal thickness than men in all ETDRS rings
      (P < 0.001). There was no interocular asymmetry (P > 0.05) and no correlation
      between IOP/CCT and retinal layer thickness. Conclusion: In CSF, age-related
      thickening was noted in RNFL, IPL, INL, OPL, and ONL. The average inner ring
      thickness decreased with age in GCL and IPL and increased in the RPE layer. The
      average outer ring thickness decreased with age in GCL, IPL, and INL layers and
      increased in OPL. The average IR and OR thickness was significantly less in women
      compared to men in all sub-fields. There was no correlation between IOP/CCT and
      retinal layer thickness.

TI  - Acceptability of Telerehabilitation for Magnification Devices for the Visually
      Impaired Using Various Approaches to Facilitate Accessibility.
PG  - 4
LID - 10.1167/tvst.11.8.4 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: We examined different methods to reduce the burden of accessing
      technology for videoconferencing during telerehabilitation for magnification
      devices for the visually impaired. Methods: During telerehabilitation studies
      over the past 5 years, vision rehabilitation providers assessed and gave training
      to visually impaired participants with newly dispensed magnification devices at
      home who connected to Zoom videoconferencing via loaner tablets or smartphones
      with assistance from (phase 1; n = 10) investigators by phone, (phase 2; n = 11) 
      local Lions Club volunteers in participants' homes, or (phase 3; n = 24) remote
      access control software in a randomized controlled trial with 13 usual care
      controls who received in-office training. All participants completed the same
      post-telerehabilitation phone survey. Results: A significantly greater proportion
      of phase 3 subjects indicated they strongly or mostly agreed that the technology 
      did not interfere with the session (96%) compared to phase 1 (60%; 95% confidence
      interval [CI], 1.2-12.5; P = 0.03) or phase 2 (55%; 95% CI, 1.8-188; P = 0.01).
      The majority indicated telerehabilitation was as accurate as in person (68%),
      they were comfortable with telerehabilitation (91%) and interested in a future
      session (83%), and their magnifier use improved (79%), with no significant
      differences in these responses between phases (all P > 0.10), including
      comparisons of participants randomized to telerehabilitation or in-office
      training in phase 3 who reported similar overall satisfaction levels (P = 0.84). 
      Conclusions: Participants across all phases reported high levels of acceptance
      for telerehabilitation, with least interference from technology using remote
      access control in phase 3. Translational Relevance: With accommodations for
      accessibility to videoconferencing technology, telerehabilitation for
      magnification devices can be a feasible, acceptable, and valuable option in
      countries with resources to support the technology.

TI  - Phakic intraocular lenses: an update and review for the treatment of myopia and
      myopic astigmatism in the United States.
PG  - 453-463
LID - 10.1097/ICU.0000000000000870 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review all phakic intraocular lenses (pIOLs) available in
      the United States for the correction of myopia or myopic astigmatism and offer a 
      clinical approach to their proper use, postoperative follow-up, and analysis of
      visual and adverse outcomes. RECENT FINDINGS: In March 2022, the FDA approved the
      EVO/EVO+ Visian ICL for widespread use, adding this lens to the two others
      available (Verisyse, Visian ICL). Cataract formation, endothelial cell loss (ECL)
      and surgical reintervention remain the most common adverse events. There are
      discrepancies between studies on ECL following implantation with pIOLs, although 
      trends can be deduced with meta-analysis. Posterior Chamber-pIOLs (PC-pIOLs),
      especially the EVO/EVO+, have an overall lower mean adverse effect and subjective
      patient symptom profile when compared to Iris Fixated-pIOLS (IF-pIOLs).
      Advancements in PC-pIOL sizing have provided a noticeable difference in visual
      and safety outcomes. SUMMARY: All pIOLs available in the United States provide
      high-quality visual correction of moderate to high myopia and/or myopia with
      astigmatism. Proper follow-up for ECL and cataract formation is warranted.

TI  - Deep Learning Models for the Diagnosis and Screening of COVID-19: A Systematic
      Review.
PG  - 397
LID - 10.1007/s42979-022-01326-3 [doi]
AB  - COVID-19, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has been declared as a global pandemic by WHO.
      Early diagnosis of COVID-19 patients may reduce the impact of coronavirus using
      modern computational methods like deep learning. Various deep learning models
      based on CT and chest X-ray images are studied and compared in this study as an
      alternative solution to reverse transcription-polymerase chain reactions. This
      study consists of three stages: planning, conduction, and analysis/reporting. In 
      the conduction stage, inclusion and exclusion criteria are applied to the
      literature searching and identification. Then, we have implemented quality
      assessment rules, where over 75 scored articles in the literature were included. 
      Finally, in the analysis/reporting stage, all the papers are reviewed and
      analysed. After the quality assessment of the individual papers, this study
      adopted 57 articles for the systematic literature review. From these reviews, the
      critical analysis of each paper, including the represented matrix for the model
      evaluation, existing contributions, and motivation, has been tracked with
      suitable illustrations. We have also interpreted several insights of each paper
      with appropriate annotation. Further, a set of comparisons has been enumerated
      with suitable discussion. Convolutional neural networks are the most commonly
      used deep learning architecture for COVID-19 disease classification and
      identification from X-ray and CT images. Various prior studies did not include
      data from a hospital setting nor did they consider data preprocessing before
      training a deep learning model.

TI  - Use of Non-pharmacological Therapies in Individuals With Migraine Eligible for
      Treatment With Monoclonal Antibodies Targeting Calcitonin Gene-Related Peptide
      (CGRP)-Signaling: A Single-Center Cross-Sectional Observational Study.
PG  - 935183
LID - 10.3389/fpain.2022.935183 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Accessibility of treatment with monoclonal antibodies targeting the
      calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) signaling pathway is impeded by regulatory
      restrictions. Affected individuals may seek out other services including
      non-pharmacological therapies. Thus, we found it timely to ascertain the use of
      non-pharmacological therapies in individuals with treatment-resistant migraine
      eligible for and naive to treatment with CGRP-signaling targeting monoclonal
      antibodies. Methods: We conducted a single-center cross-sectional observational
      study of patients eligible for and naive to treatment with monoclonal antibodies 
      targeting CGRP or its receptor. We recorded demographical information (gender,
      age, educational level, employment status, and income), disease burden (frequency
      of headache days and migraine days), previous use of preventive pharmacological
      medications for migraine, and use of non-pharmacological therapies over the past 
      3 months including frequency of interventions, costs, and patient-reported
      assessment of efficacy on a 6-point scale (0: no efficacy, 5: best possible
      efficacy). Results: We included 122 patients between 17 June 2019 and 6 January
      2020; 101 (83%) were women and the mean age was 45.2 +/- 13.3 years. One-third (n
      = 41 [34%]) had used non-pharmacological therapy within the past 3 months. Among 
      these participants, the median frequency of different interventions was 1 (IQR:
      1-2), the median number of monthly visits was 2.3 (IQR: 1.3-4), mean and median
      monthly costs were 1,086 +/- 1471, and 600 (IQR: 0-1200) DKK (1 EUR = ~7.5 DKK), 
      respectively, and median patient-reported assessment of the efficacy of
      interventions was 2 (IQR: 0-3). Conclusion: Even in a high-income country with
      freely accessible headache services and universal healthcare coverage, there was 
      a non-negligible direct cost in parallel with low satisfaction for
      non-pharmacological therapies among patients at a tertiary headache center.

TI  - Correcting magnification error in foveal avascular zone area measurements of
      optical coherence tomography angiography images with estimated axial length.
PG  - 29
LID - 10.1186/s40662-022-00299-x [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To generate and validate a method to estimate axial length estimated 
      (ALest) from spherical equivalent (SE) and corneal curvature [keratometry (K)],
      and to determine if this ALest can replace actual axial length (ALact) for
      correcting transverse magnification error in optical coherence tomography
      angiography (OCTA) images using the Littmann-Bennett formula. METHODS: Data from 
      1301 participants of the Raine Study Gen2-20 year follow-up were divided into two
      datasets to generate (n = 650) and validate (n = 651) a relationship between AL, 
      SE, and K. The developed formula was then applied to a separate dataset of 46
      participants with AL, SE, and K measurements and OCTA images to estimate and
      compare the performance of ALest against ALact in correcting transverse
      magnification error in OCTA images when measuring the foveal avascular zone area 
      (FAZA). RESULTS: The formula for ALest yielded the equation: ALest = 2.102K -
      0.4125SE + 7.268, R(2) = 0.794. There was good agreement between ALest and ALact 
      for both study cohorts. The mean difference [standard deviation (SD)] between
      FAZA corrected with ALest and ALact was 0.002 (0.015) mm(2) with the 95% limits
      of agreement (LoA) of - 0.027 to 0.031 mm(2). In comparison, mean difference (SD)
      between FAZA uncorrected and corrected with ALact was - 0.005 (0.030) mm(2), with
      95% LoA of - 0.064 to 0.054 mm(2). CONCLUSIONS: ALact is more accurate than ALest
      and hence should be used preferentially in magnification error correction in the 
      clinical setting. FAZA corrected with ALest is comparable to FAZA corrected with 
      ALact, while FAZA measurements using images corrected with ALest have a greater
      accuracy than measurements on uncorrected images. Hence, in the absence of ALact,
      clinicians should use ALest to correct for magnification error as this provides
      for more accurate measurements of fundus parameters than uncorrected images.

TI  - Validation of diagnostic accuracy of retinal image grading by trained
      non-ophthalmologist grader for detecting diabetic retinopathy and diabetic
      macular edema.
LID - 10.1038/s41433-022-02190-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To validate the fundus image grading results by a trained grader
      (Non-ophthalmologist) and an ophthalmologist grader for detecting diabetic
      retinopathy (DR) and diabetic macular oedema (DMO) against fundus examination by 
      a retina specialist (gold standard). METHODS: A prospective diagnostic accuracy
      study was conducted using 2002 non-mydriatic colour fundus images from 1001
      patients aged >/=40 years. Using the Aravind Diabetic Retinopathy Evaluation
      Software (ADRES) images were graded by both a trained non-ophthalmologist grader 
      (grader-1) and an ophthalmologist (grader-2). Sensitivity, specificity, positive 
      predictive value and negative predictive value were calculated for grader-1 and
      grader-2 against the grading results by an independent retina specialist who
      performed dilated fundus examination for every study participant. RESULTS: Out of
      1001 patients included, 42% were women and the mean +/- (SD) age was 55.8 (8.39) 
      years. For moderate or worse DR, the sensitivity and specificity for grading by
      grader-1 with respect to the gold standard was 66.9% and 91.0% respectively and
      the same for the ophthalmologist was 83.6% and 80.3% respectively. For referable 
      DMO, grader-1 and grader-2 had a sensitivity of 74.6% and 85.6% respectively and 
      a specificity of 83.7% and 79.8% respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Our results
      demonstrate good level of accuracy for the fundus image grading performed by a
      trained non-ophthalmologist which was comparable with the grading by an
      ophthalmologist. Engaging trained non-ophthalmologists potentially can enhance
      the efficiency of DR diagnosis using fundus images. Further study with multiple
      non-ophthalmologist graders is needed to verify the results and strategies to
      improve agreement for DMO diagnosis are needed.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to determine the prevalence, severity and type of
      urinary incontinence (UI) in female and male CrossFit(R) practitioners. STUDY
      DESIGN: The study design is an online cross-sectional survey distributed to
      CrossFit(R) practitioners across all Spanish regions. The questionnaire included 
      categorical questions related to CrossFit(R) practice, multiple-choice questions 
      to determine the exercises performed during reported UI symptoms, and The
      International Consultation on Incontinence Questionnaire Short-Form questionnaire
      items. RESULTS: Five hundred seventy-one practitioners (34.0 +/- 8.37 years, Body
      Mass Index 24.20 +/- 3.34 kg/m(2)) met inclusion criteria and completed the
      survey. There were and 316 females and 255 males. Around 45 % of women and 6 % of
      men reported having UI (p < 0.001). The severity of UI mainly was slight (30.3 % 
      women, 3.5 % men) and moderate (11.7 % women, 2.3 % men) (p < 0.001). Stress and 
      urgent UI were the most prevalent types among women (36 %) and men (5 %) (p <
      0.001). CONCLUSIONS: This study found that UI is relatively common among female
      CrossFit(R) practitioners, especially in repetitive jumps. The practitioners'
      profile (amateur/competitor) does not affect the prevalence or severity of UI.
      Male athletes can also experience urine leakage while performing CrossFit(R),
      although its prevalence is much lower when compared to female practitioners.

      Managed at the Emergency Department in Black Lion Hospital, Addis Ababa,
      Ethiopia, 2021.
PG  - 347-354
LID - 10.2147/OAEM.S368324 [doi]
AB  - Background: Studies showed that each year people lose their life on the road and 
      many people are disabled. The majority of this disability was caused by
      orthopedic injury related to road traffic accidents. However, in the context of
      Ethiopia, studies ascribed to orthopedic injuries related to road traffic
      accidents are limited. The study aimed to assess the pattern of orthopedic
      injuries related to road traffic accidents among patients managed at the
      emergency department of Black Lion Hospital. Methods: An institutional-based
      cross-sectional study was conducted on 354 victims of road traffic accidents with
      orthopedic injuries who were visiting the Emergency department of Black Lion
      Hospital. Patient charts were selected by systematic random sampling technique
      and the data was entered into Epi-data version 4.4.2.2 and exported to the static
      package for social science window version 26, and descriptive statistics were
      used for analysis. Results: The study reveals that males were mostly injured
      persons (71.7%) with the age group of 13-24 were the most injured. Passenger car 
      accounts 36.3% of causes of injury followed by motorbikes (27.4%) and lower limbs
      were the most common anatomic site of injuries (47.9). Of all injury types, a
      fracture is the most common one with 71.1%, especially lower limb fracture
      (42.1%). More than half victims (59.5%) had open wounds, and almost half of the
      study subjects (51.8%) experience Road traffic accidents while they are crossing 
      or walking along the way. Conclusion: Orthopedic injuries related to road traffic
      accidents are the main cause of death and disability in many individuals,
      especially in reproductive age groups. Therefore, policy-makers should be aware
      of different patterns of orthopedic injuries associated with a victim of road
      traffic accidents to have an appropriate and sustainable capacity to manage the
      orthopedic injuries.

TI  - Short-Term Efficacy of Combined ab Interno Canaloplasty and Trabeculotomy in
      Pseudophakic Eyes with Open-Angle Glaucoma.
PG  - 2295-2303
LID - 10.2147/OPTH.S367896 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To evaluate short-term outcomes of combined ab interno canaloplasty and 
      trabeculotomy in pseudophakic eyes with open-angle glaucoma. Patients and
      Methods: Series included all pseudophakic eyes with open-angle glaucoma treated
      with up to 360 degrees ab interno canaloplasty and up to 360 degrees ab interno
      trabeculotomy using a purpose-engineered device (OMNI, Sight Sciences Inc). Data 
      collected prior to surgery and out to 6-months postoperative. Surgical success
      defined as a 20% reduction in intraocular pressure (IOP) without increase in
      glaucoma medication, or discontinuation of at least one glaucoma medication
      without increase in IOP. Other primary endpoints included mean IOP and number of 
      glaucoma medications. Results: The study included 67 eyes of 52 patients with a
      mean age of 76.5 +/- 8.9 years. Preoperative mean IOP was 22.1+/-8.0 mmHg on
      2.3+/-1.4 glaucoma medications. Pressure lowering effects were sustained out to 6
      months postoperative with a mean IOP of 15.2+/-4.9 mmHg (p < 0.001) and mean
      medication reduction of 0.7+/-1.4 (p < 0.001). Surgical success rate was 69.8%
      (30 eyes) and correlated with preoperative IOP. Two patients required a secondary
      surgical intervention. Conclusion: Combined ab interno canaloplasty and
      trabeculotomy as a standalone procedure is an effective means of reducing IOP and
      medication burden in pseudophakic eyes with open-angle glaucoma.

TI  - An EvoDevo Study of Salmonid Visual Opsin Dynamics and Photopigment Spectral
      Sensitivity.
PG  - 945344
LID - 10.3389/fnana.2022.945344 [doi]
AB  - Salmonids are ideal models as many species follow a distinct developmental
      program from demersal eggs and a large yolk sac to hatching at an advanced
      developmental stage. Further, these economically important teleosts inhabit both 
      marine- and freshwaters and experience diverse light environments during their
      life histories. At a genome level, salmonids have undergone a salmonid-specific
      fourth whole genome duplication event (Ss4R) compared to other teleosts that are 
      already more genetically diverse compared to many non-teleost vertebrates. Thus, 
      salmonids display phenotypically plastic visual systems that appear to be closely
      related to their anadromous migration patterns. This is most likely due to a
      complex interplay between their larger, more gene-rich genomes and broad
      spectrally enriched habitats; however, the molecular basis and functional
      consequences for such diversity is not fully understood. This study used advances
      in genome sequencing to identify the repertoire and genome organization of visual
      opsin genes (those primarily expressed in retinal photoreceptors) from six
      different salmonids [Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar), brown trout (Salmo trutta),
      Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytcha), coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch),
      rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), and sockeye salmon (Oncorhynchus nerka)]
      compared to the northern pike (Esox lucius), a closely related non-salmonid
      species. Results identified multiple orthologues for all five visual opsin
      classes, except for presence of a single short-wavelength-sensitive-2 opsin gene.
      Several visual opsin genes were not retained after the Ss4R duplication event,
      which is consistent with the concept of salmonid rediploidization.
      Developmentally, transcriptomic analyzes of Atlantic salmon revealed differential
      expression within each opsin class, with two of the long-wavelength-sensitive
      opsins not being expressed before first feeding. Also, early opsin expression in 
      the retina was located centrally, expanding dorsally and ventrally as eye
      development progressed, with rod opsin being the dominant visual opsin
      post-hatching. Modeling by spectral tuning analysis and atomistic molecular
      simulation, predicted the greatest variation in the spectral peak of absorbance
      to be within the Rh2 class, with a approximately 40 nm difference in lambda max
      values between the four medium-wavelength-sensitive photopigments. Overall, it
      appears that opsin duplication and expression, and their respective spectral
      tuning profiles, evolved to maximize specialist color vision throughout an
      anadromous lifecycle, with some visual opsin genes being lost to tailor
      marine-based vision.

      in Polyethylene Terephthalate.

LID - 10.3390/polym14153028 [doi]
AB  - In this paper, a micromechanics-based constitutive representation of the
      deformation-induced phase transformation in polyethylene terephthalate is
      proposed and verified under biaxial loading paths. The model, formulated within
      the Eshelby inclusion theory and the micromechanics framework, considers the
      material system as a two-phase medium, in which the active interactions between
      the continuous amorphous phase and the discrete newly formed crystalline domains 
      are explicitly considered. The Duvaut-Lions viscoplastic approach is employed in 
      order to introduce the rate-dependency of the yielding behavior. The model
      parameters are identified from uniaxial data in terms of stress-strain curves and
      crystallization kinetics at two different strain rates and two different
      temperatures above glass transition temperature. Then, it is shown that the model
      predictions are in good agreement with available experimental results under equal
      biaxial and constant width conditions. The role of the crystallization on the
      intrinsic properties is emphasized thanks to the model considering the different 
      loading parameters in terms of mechanical path, strain rate and temperature.

TI  - Multiple Anthropogenic Stressors in the Galapagos Islands' Complex
      Social-Ecological System: Interactions of marine pollution, fishing pressure and 
      climate change with management recommendations.
LID - 10.1002/ieam.4661 [doi]
AB  - For decades, multiple anthropogenic stressors have threatened the Galapagos
      Islands. Widespread marine pollution such as oil spillage, persistent organic
      pollutants, metals and ocean plastic pollution has been linked to concerning
      changes in the ecophysiology and health of Galapagos species. Simultaneously,
      illegal, unreported, and unregulated fishing are reshaping the composition and
      structure of endemic and native Galapagos pelagic communities. In this novel
      review, we discuss the impact of anthropogenic pollutants and their associated
      ecotoxicological implications on Galapagos species in the face of climate change 
      stressors. We stress the importance of considering fishing pressure and marine
      pollution, in combination with climate change impacts, when assessing the
      evolutionary fitness of species inhabiting the Galapagos. For example, the
      survival of endemic marine iguanas has been negatively impacted by organic
      hydrocarbons introduced via oil spills and endangered Galapagos sea lions exhibit
      detectable concentrations of DDT, triggering potential feminization effects, and 
      compromising the species' survival. During periods of ocean warming (El Nino
      events) when endemic species undergo nutritional stress, climate change may
      increase the vulnerability of these species to the impacts of pollutants,
      resulting in the species reaching its population tipping point. Marine plastics
      are emerging as a deleterious and widespread threat to endemic species. The
      Galapagos is treasured for its historical significance and its unparalleled
      living-laboratory and display of evolutionary processes; however, this unique and
      iconic paradise will remain in jeopardy until multidisciplinary and comprehensive
      preventative management plans are put in place to mitigate and eliminate the
      effects of anthropogenic stressors facing the islands today. We present a
      critical analysis and synthesis of anthropogenic stressors with some progress
      from local and international institutional efforts and call to action more
      precautionary measures along with new management philosophies focused on
      understanding the processes of change through research to champion the
      conservation of the Galapagos. This article is protected by copyright. All rights

TI  - Epidemiology and Ecology of Influenza A Viruses among Wildlife in the Arctic.
LID - 1531 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v14071531 [doi]
AB  - Arctic regions are ecologically significant for the environmental persistence and
      geographic dissemination of influenza A viruses (IAVs) by avian hosts and other
      wildlife species. Data describing the epidemiology and ecology of IAVs among
      wildlife in the arctic are less frequently published compared to southern
      temperate regions, where prevalence and subtype diversity are more routinely
      documented. Following PRISMA guidelines, this systematic review addresses this
      gap by describing the prevalence, spatiotemporal distribution, and ecological
      characteristics of IAVs detected among wildlife and the environment in this
      understudied region of the globe. The literature search was performed in PubMed
      and Google Scholar using a set of pre-defined search terms to identify
      publications reporting on IAVs in Arctic regions between 1978 and February 2022. 
      A total of 2125 articles were initially screened, 267 were assessed for
      eligibility, and 71 articles met inclusion criteria. IAVs have been detected in
      multiple wildlife species in all Arctic regions, including seabirds, shorebirds, 
      waterfowl, seals, sea lions, whales, and terrestrial mammals, and in the
      environment. Isolates from wild birds comprise the majority of documented viruses
      derived from wildlife; however, among all animals and environmental matrices, 26 
      unique low and highly pathogenic subtypes have been characterized in the
      scientific literature from Arctic regions. Pooled prevalence across studies
      indicates 4.23% for wild birds, 3.42% among tested environmental matrices, and
      seroprevalences of 9.29% and 1.69% among marine and terrestrial mammals,
      respectively. Surveillance data are geographically biased, with most data from
      the Alaskan Arctic and many fewer reports from the Russian, Canadian, North
      Atlantic, and Western European Arctic. We highlight multiple important aspects of
      wildlife host, pathogen, and environmental ecology of IAVs in Arctic regions,
      including the role of avian migration and breeding cycles for the global spread
      of IAVs, evidence of inter-species and inter-continental reassortment at high
      latitudes, and how climate change-driven ecosystem shifts, including changes in
      the seasonal availability and distribution of dietary resources, have the
      potential to alter host-pathogen-environment dynamics in Arctic regions. We
      conclude by identifying gaps in knowledge and propose priorities for future
      research.

TI  - Adaptation and Diagnostic Potential of a Commercial Cat Interferon Gamma Release 
      Assay for the Detection of Mycobacterium bovis Infection in African Lions
      (Panthera leo).
LID - 765 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pathogens11070765 [doi]
AB  - Mycobacterium bovis (M. bovis) infection in wildlife, including lions (Panthera
      leo), has implications for individual and population health. Tools for the
      detection of infected lions are needed for diagnosis and disease surveillance.
      This study aimed to evaluate the Mabtech Cat interferon gamma (IFN-gamma)
      ELISA(Basic) kit for detection of native lion IFN-gamma in whole blood samples
      stimulated using the QuantiFERON((R)) TB Gold Plus (QFT) platform as a potential 
      diagnostic assay. The ELISA was able to detect lion IFN-gamma in
      mitogen-stimulated samples, with good parallelism, linearity, and a working range
      of 15.6-500 pg/mL. Minimal matrix interference was observed in the recovery of
      domestic cat rIFN-gamma in lion plasma. Both intra- and inter-assay
      reproducibility had a coefficient of variation less than 10%, while the limit of 
      detection and quantification were 7.8 pg/mL and 31.2 pg/mL, respectively. The
      diagnostic performance of the QFT Mabtech Cat interferon gamma release assay
      (IGRA) was determined using mycobacterial antigen-stimulated samples from M.
      bovis culture-confirmed infected (n = 8) and uninfected (n = 4) lions. A
      lion-specific cut-off value (33 pg/mL) was calculated, and the sensitivity and
      specificity were determined to be 87.5% and 100%, respectively. Although
      additional samples should be tested, the QFT Mabtech Cat IGRA could identify M.
      bovis-infected African lions.

TI  - Assessing Patients with Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency for Corneal Refractive
      Surgery: A Review and Clinical Experience.
LID - 4175 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11144175 [doi]
AB  - Alpha-1 Antitrypsin Deficiency (AATD) is an autosomal inheritable disorder that
      impairs the protease inhibitor alpha-1 antitrypsin. This disorder presents with
      various systemic effects, including liver cirrhosis, centrilobular emphysema, and
      ocular manifestations. Performing corneal refractive surgery in patients with
      AATD raises concerns regarding the increased rates of corneal erosions, corneal
      ulcerations, potential developing descemetoceles, and other ocular
      manifestations. Patient outcomes for laser-assisted in situ keratomileuses
      (LASIK), photorefractive keratectomy (PRK), small incision lenticule extraction
      (SMILE), and other ocular corrective surgeries are lacking in this population.
      This article provides experiences performing corneal refractive surgery,
      discusses the current understanding of AATD, including its ocular manifestations,
      and explores factors to consider when evaluating patients for corneal procedures.
      The aim of this paper is to address the manifestations of AATD prior to
      performing corrective vision surgery.

TI  - Giant Fornix Syndrome
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - Giant fornix syndrome (GFS) is a rare infectious inflammatory condition of the
      superior and, less commonly, the inferior conjunctival fornices, associated with 
      abnormally deep fornices, a gross recurrent bacterial infection of the
      conjunctivae, and age-related levator aponeurosis degradation. Normal fornices
      depth has been defined in healthy South Asian populations as 15.3 mm and 10.9 mm 
      for superior and inferior fornices, respectively.[1] Geoffrey Rose originally
      defined giant fornix syndrome in a retrospective case study of 12 elderly
      patients in 2004. Since he recognized this previously undefined syndrome, several
      case studies have described various treatment protocols and outcomes. Patients
      are almost exclusively over 65, with mean and median ages falling in the late
      seventies to early eighties.[2][3][4] The most common symptoms include purulent
      proteinaceous discharge, ptosis from underlying superior conjunctival
      inflammation, and chronic conjunctivitis. The most effective treatment is
      multifaceted, consisting of antimicrobial, antibiotic, steroidal, and surgical
      approaches.[5]

      macular degeneration.
PG  - 4233
LID - 10.1038/s41467-022-31707-4 [doi]
AB  - There are currently no treatments for geographic atrophy, the advanced form of
      age-related macular degeneration. Hence, innovative studies are needed to model
      this condition and prevent or delay its progression. Induced pluripotent stem
      cells generated from patients with geographic atrophy and healthy individuals
      were differentiated to retinal pigment epithelium. Integrating transcriptional
      profiles of 127,659 retinal pigment epithelium cells generated from 43
      individuals with geographic atrophy and 36 controls with genotype data, we
      identify 445 expression quantitative trait loci in cis that are asssociated with 
      disease status and specific to retinal pigment epithelium subpopulations.
      Transcriptomics and proteomics approaches identify molecular pathways
      significantly upregulated in geographic atrophy, including in mitochondrial
      functions, metabolic pathways and extracellular cellular matrix reorganization.
      Five significant protein quantitative trait loci that regulate protein expression
      in the retinal pigment epithelium and in geographic atrophy are identified - two 
      of which share variants with cis- expression quantitative trait loci, including
      proteins involved in mitochondrial biology and neurodegeneration. Investigation
      of mitochondrial metabolism confirms mitochondrial dysfunction as a core
      constitutive difference of the retinal pigment epithelium from patients with
      geographic atrophy. This study uncovers important differences in retinal pigment 
      epithelium homeostasis associated with geographic atrophy.

TI  - Blood Taurine Dynamics in Captive Lions: Relationship with Feed and Bile Acid
      Composition.
PG  - 215-223
LID - 10.1007/978-3-030-93337-1_21 [doi]
AB  - Taurine is an essential nutrient for felines including lions. Various severe
      symptoms induced by taurine deficiency have been reported for domestic and
      captive felines. Particularly for captive lions in zoos, little information
      related to taurine requirements is available. Therefore, this study evaluated the
      relationship between blood taurine concentration and taurine content in prey feed
      given at zoos, as well as the composition, types, and conjugation properties of
      bile acids (BAs) in blood collected repeatedly from four lions housed at three
      zoos. Blood taurine concentrations in four lions were within the normal range,
      although individual differences and variations were found. Taurine was abundant
      in feed supplied at the zoos. A positive correlation between blood taurine
      concentration and feed amount was observed in lions housed at the same zoo.
      Approximately 70-80% of the total BA pool was cholic acid, with 50-70% being
      taurine-conjugated. Individual differences and variations were found. No
      correlation was found between blood taurine concentration and the compositions of
      BAs in the blood. Results showed that supply of taurine was sufficient for all
      lions fed the prey feed. Future studies must be conducted to clarify influences
      on individual differences, as well as individual variations in blood taurine
      concentration and blood BA composition.

      qualitative behaviour.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1007/s00285-022-01784-6 [doi]
AB  - We introduce two 2D mechanical models reproducing the evolution of two viscous
      tissues in contact. Their main property is to model the swirling cell motions
      while keeping the tissues segregated, as observed during vertebrate embryo
      elongation. Segregation is encoded differently in the two models: by passive or
      active segregation (based on a mechanical repulsion pressure). We formally
      compute the incompressible limits of the two models, and obtain strictly
      segregated solutions. The two models thus obtained are compared. A striking
      feature in the active segregation model is the persistence of the repulsion
      pressure at the limit: a ghost effect is discussed and confronted to the
      biological data. Thanks to a transmission problem formulation at the
      incompressible limit, we show a pressure jump at the tissues' boundaries.

PG  - 536-544
LID - 10.1111/pedi.13374 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: The following report describes the evaluation of the ISPAD Science
      School for Physicians (ISSP) and for Healthcare Professionals (ISSHP) in terms of
      their efficiency and success. METHODS: All past attendees from 2000-2019 ISSP and
      2004-2019 ISSHP programs were invited to respond to an online survey to assess
      perceived outcomes of the programs on career development, scientific enhancement,
      scientific networking, and social opportunities. RESULTS: One-third of the past
      ISSP (129/428), and approximately 43% of the past ISSHP attendees (105/245)
      responded to the surveys. Most of ISSP attendees reported that the programs
      supported their career (82%) by helping to achieve a research position (59%),
      being engaged with diabetes care (68%) or research (63%) or starting a research
      fellowship (59%). Responders indicated that ISSP was effective in increasing
      interest in diabetes research (87%) and enhancing the number (66%) and quality
      (83%) of scientific productions, and promotion of international collaborations
      (86%). After the ISSP, 34% of responders received research grants. From the first
      round of the ISSHP survey (2004-2013), responders reported have improved
      knowledge (60%), gained more confidence in research (69%), undertaken a research 
      project (63%), and achieved a higher academic degree (27%). From the second round
      (2014-2019), participants indicated that the program was valuable/useful in
      workplace (94%) through understanding (89%) and conducting (68%) research and
      establishing communication from other participants (64%) or from faculty (42%).
      After the ISSHP, 17% had received awards. CONCLUSIONS: From the participants'
      viewpoint, both programs were effective in improving engagement with diabetes
      research, supporting career opportunities, increasing scientific skills, and
      enhancing networking and research activities.

TI  - A novel trophic cascade between cougars and feral donkeys shapes desert wetlands.
LID - 10.1111/1365-2656.13766 [doi]
AB  - Introduced large herbivores have partly filled ecological gaps formed in the late
      Pleistocene, when many of the Earth's megafauna were driven extinct. However,
      extant predators are generally considered incapable of exerting top-down
      influences on introduced megafauna, leading to unusually strong disturbance and
      herbivory relative to native herbivores. We report on the first documented
      predation of juvenile feral donkeys Equus africanus asinus by cougars Puma
      concolor in the Mojave and Sonoran Deserts of North America. We then investigated
      how cougar predation corresponds with differences in feral donkey behaviour and
      associated effects on desert wetlands. Focusing on a feral donkey population in
      the Death Valley National Park, we used camera traps and vegetation surveys to
      compare donkey activity patterns and impacts between wetlands with and without
      cougar predation. Donkeys were primarily diurnal at wetlands with cougar
      predation, thereby avoiding cougars. However, donkeys were active throughout the 
      day and night at sites without predation. Donkeys were ~87% less active (measured
      as hours of activity a day) at wetlands with predation (p < 0.0001). Sites with
      predation had reduced donkey disturbance and herbivory, including ~46% fewer
      access trails, 43% less trampled bare ground and 192% more canopy cover
      (PERMANOVA, R(2) = 0.22, p = 0.0003). Our study is the first to reveal a trophic 
      cascade involving cougars, feral equids and vegetation. Cougar predation appears 
      to rewire an ancient food web, with diverse implications for modern ecosystems.
      Our results suggest that protecting apex predators could have important
      implications for the ecological effects of introduced megafauna.

TI  - One-year real-world outcomes of Bevacizumab for the treatment of macular oedema
      secondary to retinal vein occlusion.
LID - 10.1111/ceo.14139 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Bevacizumab is the only agent that many people can afford, yet there are
      only limited data on whether it improves macular oedema (MO) secondary to retinal
      vein occlusion (RVO) in real-world clinical practice. Here we studied 12-month
      real-world treatment outcomes of bevacizumab for RVO-related MO. METHODS: This
      was a multicentre, observational study analysing 12-month data from the Fight
      Retinal Blindness! (FRB) database. We studied treatment-naive eyes with MO
      secondary to RVO commencing bevacizumab therapy between June 2009 and June 2019. 
      Visual acuity and central subfield thickness (CST) were measured at baseline, 6
      months and 12 months. The primary outcome was change in visual acuity from
      baseline to 12 months. RESULTS: 220 treatment naive eyes were analysed. The
      baseline VA for BRVO was better than CRVO (55.8 vs. 42.6 LogMAR letters) and this
      gap widened over the 12-month period, with a 12-month VA change of +14.0 (95% CI 
      11.1, 16.8) letters for BRVO and +11.9 (95% CI 6.4, 17.4) for CRVO. The mean CST 
      at baseline was 511mum for BRVO and 627mum for CRVO, falling at 12 months by
      -155mum (-190, -121) in BRVO and -198mum (-252, -145) in CRVO. The median number 
      of injections for BRVO and CRVO completers was 7 (5, 9). CONCLUSIONS: Bevacizumab
      can be an effective treatment of RVO-MO in a real-world setting with outcomes
      approaching those reported by the seminal clinical trials. The functional and
      anatomical outcomes of intravitreal therapy were better for BRVO than CRVO.

AB  - Although being a really active area of research, television super-resolution
      remains a difficult problem. Additionally, it is noted that the blur motion and
      computational crisis hinder the enhancement. As a result, the goal of this
      research is to present a brand-new smart SR framework for the camera shot. To
      create High Resolution (HR) videos, first frames in RGB format are converted to
      HSV and then the V-channel is enhanced. In order to create enriched video frames,
      a high - dimension grid with enhanced pixel intensity is then created. This paper
      introduces a particular progression to enable this: Motion estimation, Cubic
      Spline Interpolation, and Deblurring or Sharpening are the three methods. By
      carefully adjusting the parameters, the cubic spline interpolation is improved
      during operation. A brand-new hybrid technique dubbed Lion with Particle Swarm
      Velocity Update (LPSO-VU), which combines the principles of the Lion Algorithm
      (LA) and Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithms, is presented for this
      optimal tuning purpose. Finally, using the BRISQUE, SDME, and ESSIM metrics, the 
      adequacy of the method is contrasted to other traditional models, and its
      superiority is demonstrated. Accordingly, the analysis shows that the suggested
      LPSO-VU model for video frame 1 is 16.6%, 25.56%, 26.2%, 26.2%, and 27.2%
      superior to the previous systems like PSO, GWO, WOA, ROA, MF-ROA, and LA,
      respectively, in terms of BRISQUE.

LID - 10.1016/j.amsu.2022.104017 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Although intra-orbital foreign bodies (IOrFBs) are commonly seen in
      daily ophthalmology practice, rarely, they can have very unusual clinical
      presentations, especially nonmetallic FBs. Presentation of case: A 33-year-old
      male presented with sudden onset right lower lid swelling and tearing. He was
      initially tolerating the symptoms, however, it got progressively worse, so he
      came two weeks after the initiation of symptoms. His eye vitals were within
      normal limit, including the visual acuity of 6/6 OU. Additionally, slit lamp and 
      fundus examinations were benign. Concern was for infectious etiology with unclear
      source. After a lengthy conversation, he recalled falling on the ground with face
      down about 16 months ago. However, he stated that he had remained asymptomatic
      and never went for treatment after the incident. Non-contrast CT of head and
      orbit showed hyperdense tract in medial aspect of right eye adjacent to the
      globe, piercing across the bilateral ethmoidal sinuses. Thus, a diagnosis of
      retained IOrbFB was made. He underwent surgery where a 5cm rotten wood was
      extracted. Post-surgical course was uncomplicated. Not all penetrating
      intra-orbital foreign bodies present immediately after the incident. In our case 
      the patient remained asymptomatic for 16 months. Conclusion: Therefore, when
      dealing with an ocular infection of unclear source, clinicians should ask about
      distant histories of ocular or facial injuries to assess intraocular foreign
      bodies.

AB  - The analysis of wave patterns in a structure which possesses periodicity in the
      spatial and temporal dimensions is presented. The topic of imperfect chiral
      interfaces is also considered. Although causality is fundamental for physical
      processes, natural wave phenomena can be observed when a wave is split at a
      temporal interface. A wave split at a spatial interface is a more common
      occurrence; however, when the coefficients of the governing equations are
      time-dependent, the temporal interface becomes important. Here, the associated
      frontal waves are studied, and regimes are analysed where the growth of the
      solution in time is found. Imperfect interfaces, across which the displacements
      are discontinuous, are also considered in the vector case of chiral elastic
      systems. Analytical study and asymptotic approximations are supplied with
      illustrative numerical examples. This article is part of the theme issue 'Wave
      generation and transmission in multi-scale complex media and structured
      metamaterials (part 1)'.

TI  - Relevance of Anti-HLA Antibody Strength Underestimation in Single Antigen Bead
      Assay for Shared Eplets.
LID - 10.1097/TP.0000000000004247 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: HLAs contain combinations of multiple eplets, sometimes shared
      between numerous HLA alleles. Some authors suggested that single antigen bead
      (SAB) assays may underestimate the signal of anti-HLA antibodies (Ab) when
      several beads share the targeted eplet. However, this assumption has not yet been
      validated experimentally. METHODS: We selected 5 eplets shared by 1-24 beads of
      the routine SAB kits: the eplet 163LS/G; the 3 eplets 127K, 62GE, and 62GRN
      thereafter called cross-reactive group 2C; the 82LR eplet, well-known as Bw4; the
      locally called QB2A5 eplet associated with the DQA1*05:01/DQB1*02:01 combination;
      and the 40GR DQ eplet. We selected a dozen of sera for each eplet with Ab mean
      fluorescence intensity (MFI) between 1000 and 15 000 for the beads carrying the
      targeted eplet. We tested them with the classical SAB panel (SABp), with an
      isolated bead carrying the eplet (isolated SAB [SABi]) and with a mixture of both
      (SABp+i). RESULTS: No significant difference in MFI was detected among SABi,
      SABp, and SABp+i conditions for all the eplets. CONCLUSIONS: We noticed only a
      nonsignificant difference in the Ab MFI signal due to eplet sharing on the SAB
      assay. We, therefore, conclude that this phenomenon should no longer be
      considered as a significant risk factor during patient follow-up pre- or
      posttransplantation.

TI  - Metagenomic Investigation of Ticks From Kenyan Wildlife Reveals Diverse Microbial
      Pathogens and New Country Pathogen Records.

LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.932224 [doi]
AB  - Focusing on the utility of ticks as xenosurveillance sentinels to expose
      circulating pathogens in Kenyan drylands, host-feeding ticks collected from wild 
      ungulates [buffaloes, elephants, giraffes, hartebeest, impala, rhinoceros (black 
      and white), zebras (Grevy's and plains)], carnivores (leopards, lions, spotted
      hyenas, wild dogs), as well as regular domestic and Boran cattle were screened
      for pathogens using metagenomics. A total of 75 host-feeding ticks [Rhipicephalus
      (97.3%) and Amblyomma (2.7%)] collected from 15 vertebrate taxa were sequenced in
      46 pools. Fifty-six pathogenic bacterial species were detected in 35 pools
      analyzed for pathogens and relative abundances of major phyla. The most
      frequently observed species was Escherichia coli (62.8%), followed by Proteus
      mirabilis (48.5%) and Coxiella burnetii (45.7%). Francisella tularemia and
      Jingmen tick virus (JMTV) were detected in 14.2 and 13% of the pools,
      respectively, in ticks collected from wild animals and cattle. This is one of the
      first reports of JMTV in Kenya, and phylogenetic reconstruction revealed
      significant divergence from previously known isolates and related viruses. Eight 
      fungal species with human pathogenicity were detected in 5 pools (10.8%). The
      vector-borne filarial pathogens (Brugia malayi, Dirofilaria immitis, Loa loa),
      protozoa (Plasmodium spp., Trypanosoma cruzi), and environmental and
      water-/food-borne pathogens (Entamoeba histolytica, Encephalitozoon intestinalis,
      Naegleria fowleri, Schistosoma spp., Toxoplasma gondii, and Trichinella spiralis)
      were detected. Documented viruses included human mastadenovirus C, Epstein-Barr
      virus and bovine herpesvirus 5, Trinbago virus, and Guarapuava tymovirus-like
      virus 1. Our findings confirmed that host-feeding ticks are an efficient sentinel
      for xenosurveillance and demonstrate clear potential for wildlife-livestock-human
      pathogen transfer in the Kenyan landscape.

AB  - More than 200 million children under the age of 5 years are affected by
      malnutrition worldwide according to the World Health Organization. The Barbados
      Nutrition Study (BNS) is a 55-year longitudinal study on a Barbadian cohort with 
      histories of moderate to severe protein-energy malnutrition (PEM) limited to the 
      first year of life and a healthy comparison group. Using quantitative
      electroencephalography (EEG), differences in brain function during childhood
      (lower alpha1 activity and higher theta, alpha2 and beta activity) have
      previously been highlighted between participants who suffered from early PEM and 
      controls. In order to determine whether similar differences persisted into
      adulthood, our current study used recordings obtained during a Go-No-Go task in a
      subsample of the original BNS cohort [population size (N) = 53] at ages 45-51
      years. We found that previously malnourished adults [sample size (n) = 24] had a 
      higher rate of omission errors on the task relative to controls (n = 29).
      Evoked-Related Potentials (ERP) were significantly different in participants with
      histories of early PEM, who presented with lower N2 amplitudes. These findings
      are typically associated with impaired conflict monitoring and/or attention
      deficits and may therefore be linked to the attentional and executive function
      deficits that have been previously reported in this cohort in childhood and again
      in middle adulthood.

AB  - People living with Parkinson's disease (PD) with poor verbal fluency have an
      increased risk of developing dementia. This study examines the neural mechanisms 
      underpinning semantic fluency deficits in patients with PD with mild cognitive
      impairment (PD-MCI) compared to those without MCI (PD-NC) and control
      participants without PD (non-PD). Thirty-seven (37) participants with PD
      completed a cognitive assessment battery to identify MCI (13 PD-MCI). Twenty sex-
      and age-matched non-PD patients also participated. Participants were scanned (3T 
      Siemens PRISMA) while performing semantic fluency, semantic switching, and
      automatic speech tasks. The number of responses and fMRI data for semantic
      generation and semantic switching were analyzed. Participants also completed a
      series of verbal fluency tests outside the scanner, including letter fluency.
      Participants with PD-MCI performed significantly worse than PD-NC and non-PD
      participants during semantic fluency and semantic switching tasks. PD-MCI
      patients showed greater activity in the right angular gyrus than PD-NC and non-PD
      patients during semantic switching. Increased right angular activity correlated
      with worse verbal fluency performance outside the scanner. Our study showed that 
      the PD-MCI group performed worse on semantic fluency than either the PD-NC or
      non-PD groups. Increased right angular gyrus activity in participants with PD-MCI
      during semantic switching suggests early compensatory mechanisms, predicting the 
      risk of future dementia in PD.

AB  - Genetic medicine is offering hope as new therapies are emerging for many
      previously untreatable diseases. The eye is at the forefront of these advances,
      as exemplified by the approval of Luxturna(R) by the United States Food and Drug 
      Administration (US FDA) in 2017 for the treatment of one form of Leber Congenital
      Amaurosis (LCA), an inherited blindness. Luxturna(R) was also the first in vivo
      human gene therapy to gain US FDA approval. Numerous gene therapy clinical trials
      are ongoing for other eye diseases, and novel delivery systems, discovery of new 
      drug targets and emerging technologies are currently driving the field forward.
      Targeting RNA, in particular, is an attractive therapeutic strategy for genetic
      disease that may have safety advantages over alternative approaches by avoiding
      permanent changes in the genome. In this regard, antisense oligonucleotides (ASO)
      and RNA interference (RNAi) are the currently popular strategies for developing
      RNA-targeted therapeutics. Enthusiasm has been further fuelled by the emergence
      of clustered regularly interspersed short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR
      associated (Cas) systems that allow targeted manipulation of nucleic acids.
      RNA-targeting CRISPR-Cas systems now provide a novel way to develop RNA-targeted 
      therapeutics and may provide superior efficiency and specificity to existing
      technologies. In addition, RNA base editing technologies using CRISPR-Cas and
      other modalities also enable precise alteration of single nucleotides. In this
      review, we showcase advances made by RNA-targeting systems for ocular disease,
      discuss applications of ASO and RNAi technologies, highlight emerging CRISPR-Cas 
      systems and consider the implications of RNA-targeting therapeutics in the
      development of future drugs to treat eye disease.

      perceived benefit from a protected area.

AB  - Providing sufficient benefits to local people can be an important component of
      effective and equitable conservation, especially where local communities face
      substantial opportunity costs or disbenefits from conservation. However, the
      distribution of benefits to local people is often inadequate or inequitable. In
      this study we investigated the heterogeneity in the extent to which people living
      near Hwange National Park (HNP), Zimbabwe, perceive benefit from the presence of 
      the park. Specifically, we examined the relationships between a diverse set of
      candidate predictor variables and perceived benefit from HNP. Our candidate
      predictor variables broadly relate to personal assets, social capital, value
      orientation, fear of lions, and belief and participation in human-wildlife
      conflict mitigation schemes. One third of respondents reported that their
      household experienced at least some benefits from HNP. Of all respondents, 6%
      perceived their household to benefit strongly from HNP and 2% very strongly.
      Livestock loss to wildlife was the most important factor for predicting perceived
      benefit, with those suffering more loss less likely to perceive benefit. Multiple
      demographic factors predicted perceived benefit with, for instance, older people 
      and those with less education perceiving less benefit. Employment in
      conservation-related work positively affected perceived benefit, whereas fear of 
      lions had a negative impact. Social capital appeared to have a positive influence
      on perceived benefit from HNP. The relationship between social capital and
      perceived benefit was positive and plateauing, which suggests that social capital
      is especially impactful on the benefit perceived by individuals reporting the
      least social capital. We also found a positive association between belief in
      compensation schemes and perceived benefit from HNP. We posit hypotheses for this
      association but are unable to determine the underlying drivers of this
      relationship. Finally, participation in the community guardians programme, a
      human-lion conflict mitigation programme, was positively related to perceived
      benefit from HNP. Thus, our findings emphasise the value of considering a diverse
      array of factors when investigating park-people relationships and yield insights 
      for improving the equitability of conservation in and around HNP and similar
      systems.

AB  - Marine mammals, regarded as sentinels of aquatic ecosystem health, are exposed to
      different pathogens and parasites under natural conditions. We surveyed live
      South American fur seals Arctocephalus australis and South American sea lions
      Otaria flavescens in Uruguay for Leptospira spp., canine distemper virus (CDV),
      Mycobacterium spp., Toxoplasma gondii, and Neospora caninum. Samples were
      collected from 2007 to 2013. The seroprevalence of Leptospira spp. was 37.6%
      positive, 50.9% negative, and 11.5% suspect for A. australis (n = 61) while for
      O. flavescens (n = 12) it was 67% positive, 25% negative, and 8% suspect. CDV RNA
      was not detected in any of the analyzed samples. Most animals tested seropositive
      to tuberculosis antigens by WiZo ELISA (A. australis: 29/30; O. flavescens:
      20/20); reactivity varied with a novel ELISA test (antigens MPB70, MPB83, ESAT6
      and MPB59). Seroprevalence against N. caninum and T. gondii was 6.7 and 13.3%
      positive for O. flavescens and 0 and 2.2% positive for A. australis respectively.
      To evaluate possible sources of infection for pinnipeds, wild rats Rattus rattus 
      and semi-feral cats Felis catus were also tested for Leptospira spp. and T.
      gondii respectively. Water samples tested for Leptospira revealed saprofitic L.
      bioflexa. Pathogenic Leptospira were detected in the kidneys of 2 rats, and cats 
      tested positive for T. gondii (100%). These results represent a substantial
      contribution to the study of the health status of wild pinnipeds in Uruguay.

      californianus pups in the Gulf of California, Mexico.
PG  - e13235
LID - 10.7717/peerj.13235 [doi]
AB  - Background: The gastrointestinal (GI) bacterial communities of sea lions
      described to date have occasionally revealed large intraspecific variability,
      which may originate from several factors including different methodological
      approaches. Indeed, GI bacterial community surveys commonly rely on the use of a 
      single hypervariable region (HR) of 16S rRNA, which may result in misleading
      structural interpretations and limit comparisons among studies. Here, we
      considered a multi-locus analysis by targeting six HRs of 16S rRNA with the aims 
      of (i) comprehensively assessing the GI bacterial consortium in rectal samples
      from Zalophus californianus pups and (ii) elucidating structural variations among
      the tested HRs. In addition, we evaluated which HRs may be most suitable for
      identifying intrinsic, structurally related microbiome characteristics, such as
      geographic variations or functional capabilities. Methods: We employed a Short
      MUltiple Regions Framework (SMURF) approach using the Ion 16S Metagenomic Kit.
      This kit provides different proprietary primers designed to target six HRs of the
      16S rRNA gene. To date, the only analytical pipeline available for this kit is
      the Ion Reporter Software of Thermo Fisher Scientific. Therefore, we propose an
      in-house pipeline to use with open-access tools, such as QIIME2 and PICRUSt 2, in
      downstream bioinformatic analyses. Results: As hypothesized, distinctive
      bacterial community profiles were observed for each analyzed HR. A higher number 
      of bacterial taxa were detected with the V3 and V6-V7 regions. Conversely, the V8
      and V9 regions were less informative, as we detected a lower number of taxa. The 
      synergistic information of these HRs suggests that the GI microbiota of Zalophus 
      californianus pups is predominated by five bacterial phyla: Proteobacteria
      (~50%), Bacteroidetes (~20%), Firmicutes (~18%), Fusobacteria (~7%), and
      Epsilonbacteraeota (~4%). Notably, our results differ at times from previously
      reported abundance profiles, which may promote re-evaluations of the GI bacterial
      compositions in sea lions and other pinniped species that have been reported to
      date. Moreover, consistent geographic differences were observed only with the V3,
      V4, and V6-V7 regions. In addition, these HRs also presented higher numbers of
      predicted molecular pathways, although no significant functional changes were
      apparent. Together, our results suggests that multi-locus analysis should be
      encouraged in GI microbial surveys, as single-locus approaches may result in
      misleading structural results that hamper the identification of structurally
      related microbiome features.

TI  - Reconstructing firm-level interactions in the Dutch input-output network from
      production constraints.
PG  - 11847
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-13996-3 [doi]
AB  - Recent crises have shown that the knowledge of the structure of input-output
      networks, at the firm level, is crucial when studying economic resilience from
      the microscopic point of view of firms that try to rewire their connections under
      supply and demand constraints. Unfortunately, empirical inter-firm network data
      are protected by confidentiality, hence rarely accessible. The available methods 
      for network reconstruction from partial information treat all pairs of nodes as
      potentially interacting, thereby overestimating the rewiring capabilities of the 
      system and the implied resilience. Here, we use two big data sets of transactions
      in the Netherlands to represent a large portion of the Dutch inter-firm network
      and document its properties. We, then, introduce a generalized maximum-entropy
      reconstruction method that preserves the production function of each firm in the 
      data, i.e. the input and output flows of each node for each product type. We
      confirm that the new method becomes increasingly more reliable in reconstructing 
      the empirical network as a finer product resolution is considered and can,
      therefore, be used as a realistic generative model of inter-firm networks with
      fine production constraints. Moreover, the likelihood of the model directly
      enumerates the number of alternative network configurations that leave each firm 
      in its current production state, thereby estimating the reduction in the rewiring
      capability of the system implied by the observed input-output constraints.

TI  - Medium-Term Failure of Descemet's Stripping Only and Fuchs' Dystrophy With
      Pancorneal Guttae.
PG  - 1064-1067
LID - 10.1097/ICO.0000000000002873 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to report the medium-term outcome of our
      index case of Descemet stripping only (DSO) in the clinical setting of Fuchs
      endothelial corneal dystrophy with pancorneal guttae. METHODS: This was a
      retrospective case report. RESULTS: A 44-year-old woman with bilateral Fuchs
      endothelial corneal dystrophy was referred for consideration of DSO. At initial
      slit-lamp examination, widespread guttae were observed with no clear zone
      visible. Confocal microscopic examination also failed to isolate a population of 
      undisturbed endothelial cells. DSO with supplemental ripasudil was performed with
      corneal clearance achieved at 2.5 months. A stable result was obtained for 18
      months with a subsequent slow decline in vision and return of diurnal
      fluctuation. At 3.5 years after DSO, DMEK was performed with resolution of
      symptoms. CONCLUSIONS: Medium-term failure in this clinical setting is further
      evidence that DSO is likely best offered to patients with central guttae but a
      clear corneal periphery, indicative of a healthy cell reservoir.

TI  - The Relationship Between Fetal Growth and Retinal Nerve Fiber Layer Thickness in 
      a Cohort of Young Adults.
PG  - 8
LID - 10.1167/tvst.11.7.8 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To explore relationships between patterns of fetal anthropometric
      growth, as reflective of fetal wellbeing, and global retinal nerve fiber layer
      (RNFL) thickness measured in young adulthood. Methods: Participants (n = 481)
      from within a Western Australian pregnancy cohort study underwent five serial
      ultrasound scans during gestation, with fetal biometry measured at each scan.
      Optic disc parameters were measured via spectral-domain optical coherence
      tomography imaging at a 20-year follow-up eye examination. Generalized estimating
      equations were used to evaluate differences in global RNFL thickness between
      groups of participants who had undergone similar growth trajectories based on
      fetal head circumference (FHC), abdominal circumference (FAC), femur length
      (FFL), and estimated fetal weight (EFW). Results: Participants with consistently 
      large FHCs throughout gestation had significantly thicker global RNFLs than those
      with any other pattern of FHC growth (P = 0.023), even after adjustment for
      potential confounders (P = 0.037). Based on model fit statistics, FHC growth
      trajectory was a better predictor of global RNFL thickness than birth weight or
      head circumference at birth. RNFL thickness did not vary significantly between
      groups of participants with different growth trajectories based on FAC, FFL, or
      EFW. Conclusions: FHC growth is associated with RNFL thickness in young adulthood
      and, moreover, is a better predictor than either birth weight or head
      circumference at birth. Translational Relevance: This research demonstrates an
      association between intrauterine growth and long-term optic nerve health,
      providing a basis for further exploring the extent of the influence of fetal
      wellbeing on clinical conditions linked to RNFL thinning.

TI  - The early impacts of COVID-19 on unpaid carers of people living with dementia:
      part II of a mixed-methods systematic review.
PG  - 1-16
LID - 10.1080/13607863.2022.2084510 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: With a lack of existing comprehensive reviews, the aim of this
      mixed-method systematic review was to synthesise the evidence on the early
      impacts of the pandemic on unpaid dementia carers across the globe. METHODS: This
      review was registered on PROSPERO [CDR42021248050]. PubMed, CINAHL, Embase,
      Scopus and Web of Science were searched from 2020 to July 2021. Studies were
      included if they reported on the different impacts of the pandemic on unpaid
      dementia carers aged 18+, with papers published in English, German, Polish, or
      Spanish. A number of research team members were involved in the selection of
      studies following PRISMA guidance. RESULTS: Thirty-six studies (43 papers) from
      18 countries reported on the early impact of the pandemic on unpaid dementia
      carers. Impacts were noted on accessing care and support; carer burden; and
      well-being. Studies found that carers had limited access to care and support
      services, increased workload, enhanced feelings of social isolation, and reduced 
      wellbeing. Specifically, reductions in access to care and support increased
      carer's unpaid caring tasks, removing any opportunities for temporary respite,
      and thus further increasing carer burden and reducing mental well-being in many. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The needs of unpaid dementia carers appear to have increased during 
      the pandemic, without adequate support provided. Policy initiatives need to
      enable better mental health support and formal care provision for unpaid carers
      and their relatives with dementia, whilst future research needs to explore the
      long-term implications of carer needs in light of care home restrictions and care
      delivery.

TI  - Sea lions could use multilateration localization for object tracking as tested
      with bio-inspired whisker arrays.
PG  - 11764
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-15904-1 [doi]
AB  - Previous behavioural research on live sea lions has shown that they are able to
      detect the direction of oncoming vortices, even when impacting contralaterally.
      These experiments showed that the whisker system and the animal's neural
      processing is seemingly able to detect the Direction of Arrival (DoA) from just
      one side of the heads vibrissal pads. Therefore, temporal differences between
      whisker stimulation is a likely method for determining the angle. Herein, a
      theoretical model is presented based on multilateration, and tested by
      experimental studies on a 2D array of bio-inspired whiskers with regular spacing,
      and a 3D array of bio-inspired whiskers on a model head of a sea lion, as used in
      our previous studies. The results show that arrays of whiskers can in principle
      work as antennae to determine the DoA. This detection of the DoA is achieved by
      cross-correlation of triplets of whiskers, and Time Difference Of Arrival based
      multilateration, a method similar to signal processing in modern communication
      systems and other source localization applications. The results on the 2D array
      are conclusive and clearly support the hypothesis, while increased uncertainties 
      were found for the 3D array, which could be explained by structural shortcomings 
      of the experimental model. Possible ways to improve the signal are discussed.

AB  - PURPOSE: Unclean cooking fuels such as wood and kerosene have been associated
      with cataract in cross-sectional studies. This study sought to determine whether 
      exposure to unclean cooking fuels was associated with subsequent cataract
      progression. DESIGN: Prospective cohort study. METHODS: This is a secondary
      observational analysis of the community-based Antioxidants in Prevention of
      Cataracts trial (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT01664819). The exposure of interest was
      cooking fuel type, measured at baseline. Main outcome measures were baseline
      cataract severity and self-reported cataract surgery at a 15-year visit. RESULTS:
      Baseline and 15-year follow-up data were available for 798 and 579 participants, 
      respectively. Wood or kerosene was used by 711/798 (89.1%) baseline participants,
      including 539/579 (93.1%) participants with complete follow-up. Cooking fuel type
      was not associated with cataract severity at baseline (p=0.443). Out of 8,334
      person-years of follow up, 90 cataract surgeries were observed over 15 years
      (1.08 surgeries per 100 person-years; 95%CI 0.87-1.32). Use of wood or kerosene
      was not associated with 15-year incidence of cataract surgery relative to
      individuals using propane (adjusted p=0.154). Cataract surgery was more common in
      older individuals (HR 1.1 per year, 95%CI 1.1-1.2, p<0.001), those with baseline 
      myopia (HR 2.1, 95%CI 1.2-3.5, p=0.009) and women (HR 3.5, 95%CI 1.2 to 10.1,
      p=0.019). CONCLUSIONS: This study found no association between unclean cooking
      fuels and cataract progression over a 15-year period. No other modifiable risk
      factors were associated with incident self-reported cataract surgery.

AB  - PURPOSE: To describe the long-term management of bilateral limbal stem cell
      deficiency secondary to a severe chemical burn. METHODS: Descriptive case report.
      IMPORTANCE: This case highlights the importance of early intervention in ocular
      chemical burns for the preservation of tissue integrity and avoidance of
      perforation. We also review the use of proper ocular surface reconstructive
      techniques to restore the function of the limbal area, as well as the
      immunomodulatory strategies and follow-up needed for these interventions.

TI  - Resuscitation of Term Compromised and Asphyctic Newborns: Better with Intact
      Umbilical Cord?
PG  - 706-718
LID - 10.1055/a-1804-3268 [doi]
AB  - The authors hypothesize that particularly severely compromised and asphyctic term
      infants in need of resuscitation may benefit from delayed umbilical cord clamping
      (after several minutes). Although evidence is sparse, the underlying
      pathophysiological mechanisms support this assumption. For this review the
      authors have analyzed the available research. Based on these data they conclude
      that it may be unfavorable to immediately clamp the cord of asphyctic newborns
      (e.g., after shoulder dystocia) although recommended in current guidelines to
      provide quick neonatological support. Compression of the umbilical cord or thorax
      obstructs venous flow to the fetus more than arterial flow to the placenta. The
      fetus is consequently cut off from a supply of oxygenated, venous blood. This may
      cause not only hypoxemia and consecutive hypoxia during delivery but possibly
      also hypovolemia. Immediate cord clamping may aggravate the situation of the
      already compromised newborn, particularly if the cord is cut before the lungs are
      ventilated. By contrast, delayed cord clamping leads to fetoplacental transfusion
      of oxygenated venous blood, which may buffer an existing acidosis. Furthermore,
      it may enhance blood volume by up to 20%, leading to higher levels of various
      blood components, such as red and white blood cells, thrombocytes, mesenchymal
      stem cells, immunoglobulins, and iron. In addition, the resulting increase in
      pulmonary perfusion may compensate for an existing hypoxemia or hypoxia. Early
      cord clamping before lung perfusion reduces the preload of the left ventricle and
      hinders the establishment of sufficient circulation. Animal models and clinical
      trials support this opinion. The authors raise the question whether it would be
      better to resuscitate compromised newborns with intact umbilical cords. Obstetric
      and neonatal teams need to work even closer together to improve neonatal
      outcomes.

TI  - Mechanical Methods for the Induction of Labour After Previous Caesarean Section -
      An Updated, Evidence-based Review.
PG  - 727-735
LID - 10.1055/a-1731-7441 [doi]
AB  - There are currently no up-to-date evidence-based recommendations on the preferred
      method to induce labour after previous Caesarean section, especially for patients
      with unripe cervix, as randomised controlled studies are lacking. Intravenous
      oxytocin and misoprostol are contraindicated in these women because of the high
      risk of uterine rupture. In women with ripe cervix (Bishop Score > 6),
      intravenous administration of oxytocin is an effective procedure with comparable 
      rates of uterine rupture to those with spontaneous onset of labour. Vaginal
      prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2 ) and mechanical methods (balloon catheters, hygroscopic
      cervical dilators) are effective methods to induce labour in pregnant women with 
      unripe cervix and previous Caesarean section. According to current guidelines,
      the administration of PGE 2 is associated with a higher rate of uterine rupture
      compared to balloon catheters. Balloon catheters are therefore a suitable
      alternative to PGE 2 to induce labour after previous Caesarean section, even
      though this is an off-label use. In addition to two meta-analyses published in
      2016, 12 mostly retrospective cohort/observational studies with low to moderate
      levels of evidence have been published on mechanical methods of cervical ripening
      after previous Caesarean section. But because of the significant heterogeneity of
      the studies, substantial differences in study design, and insufficient numbers of
      pregnant women included in the studies, it is not possible to make any
      evidence-based recommendations based on these studies. According to a recent
      meta-analysis, the average rate using balloon catheters is approximately 53% and 
      the average rate after spontaneous onset of labour is 72%. The uterine rupture
      rate was 0.2-0.9% for vaginal PGE 2 and 0.56-0.94% for balloon catheters and is
      therefore comparable to the uterine rupture rate associated with spontaneous
      onset of labour. According to the product informations, hygroscopic cervical
      dilators (Dilapan-S) are currently the only method which is not contraindicated
      for cervical ripening/induction of labour in women with previous Caesarean
      section, although data are insufficient. Well-designed, randomised, controlled
      studies with sufficient case numbers comparing balloon catheters and hygroscopic 
      cervical dilators with mechanical methods and vaginal prostaglandin E 2 /oral
      misoprostol are therefore necessary to allow proper decision-making.

AB  - Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a heterogeneous group of blinding
      disorders, which result in dysfunction or death of the light-sensing cone and rod
      photoreceptors. Despite individual IRDs (Inherited retinal disease) being rare,
      collectively, they affect up to 1:2000 people worldwide, causing a significant
      socioeconomic burden, especially when cone-mediated central vision is affected.
      This study uses the Pde6c(cpfl1) mouse model of achromatopsia, a cone-specific
      vision loss IRD (Inherited retinal disease), to investigate the potential
      gene-independent therapeutic benefits of a histone demethylase inhibitor GSK-J4
      on cone cell survival. We investigated the effects of GSK-J4 treatment on cone
      cell survival in vivo and ex vivo and changes in cone-specific gene expression
      via single-cell RNA sequencing. A single intravitreal GSK-J4 injection led to
      transcriptional changes in pathways involved in mitochondrial dysfunction,
      endoplasmic reticulum stress, among other key epigenetic pathways, highlighting
      the complex interplay between methylation and acetylation in healthy and diseased
      cones. Furthermore, continuous administration of GSK-J4 in retinal explants
      increased cone survival. Our results suggest that IRD (Inherited retinal
      disease)-affected cones respond positively to epigenetic modulation of histones, 
      indicating the potential of this approach in developing a broad class of novel
      therapies to slow cone degeneration.

AB  - PURPOSE: To establish disease progression rates in total lesion size (TLS),
      decreased autofluorescence (DAF) area, total macular volume (TMV) and mean
      macular sensitivity (MMS) in PRPH2-associated retinal dystrophy. DESIGN: Single
      centre, retrospective chart review. PARTICIPANTS: Patients with heterozygous
      pathogenic or likely pathogenic PRPH2 variants. METHODS: Patients with serial
      ultra-widefield (UWF) fundus autofluorescence (FAF), optical coherence tomography
      (OCT) and MAIA microperimetry with at least 1 year of follow-up were included.
      Linear correlation was performed in all eyes of all patients to determine the
      rate of change over time. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcome measures included change
      in TLS, DAF area, TMV and MMS. RESULTS: Twelve patients (mean age=55) from 10
      unrelated families attended 100 clinic visits over a mean(SD) of 4.7(2.0) years. 
      Mean(SD) TLS and DAF radius expansion was 0.14(0.12) and 0.10(0.08) mm/year
      respectively. Mean (SD) TMV change was -0.071(0.040) mm(3)/year with no
      interocular difference (p=0.20) and strong interocular correlation (r(2)=0.88,
      p<0.01). Mean(SD) MMS change was -0.10(1.25) dB/year. MMS declined in four and
      improved in six patients. MMS was subnormal despite a TMV within the normal
      range. CONCLUSIONS: Serial measurements of UWF-FAF-derived TLS and DAF showed
      slow expansion. TMV maybe a more sensitive measure than MMS in detecting disease 
      progression.

      chylothorax in paediatric CHD.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A standardised multi-site approach to manage paediatric post-operative
      chylothorax does not exist and leads to unnecessary practice variation. The
      Chylothorax Work Group utilised the Pediatric Critical Care Consortium
      infrastructure to address this gap. METHODS: Over 60 multi-disciplinary providers
      representing 22 centres convened virtually as a quality initiative to develop an 
      algorithm to manage paediatric post-operative chylothorax. Agreement was
      objectively quantified for each recommendation in the algorithm by utilising an
      anonymous survey. "Consensus" was defined as >/= 80% of responses as "agree" or
      "strongly agree" to a recommendation. In order to determine if the algorithm
      recommendations would be correctly interpreted in the clinical environment, we
      developed ex vivo simulations and surveyed patients who developed the algorithm
      and patients who did not. RESULTS: The algorithm is intended for all children
      (<18 years of age) within 30 days of cardiac surgery. It contains rationale for
      11 central chylothorax management recommendations; diagnostic criteria and
      evaluation, trial of fat-modified diet, stratification by volume of daily output,
      timing of first-line medical therapy for "low" and "high" volume patients, and
      timing and duration of fat-modified diet. All recommendations achieved
      "consensus" (agreement >80%) by the workgroup (range 81-100%). Ex vivo
      simulations demonstrated good understanding by developers (range 94-100%) and
      non-developers (73%-100%). CONCLUSIONS: The quality improvement effort represents
      the first multi-site algorithm for the management of paediatric post-operative
      chylothorax. The algorithm includes transparent and objective measures of
      agreement and understanding. Agreement to the algorithm recommendations was >80%,
      and overall understanding was 94%.

TI  - Endometrial hyperplasia and pyometra in captive lions (Panthera leo) and tigers
      (Panthera tigris).
PG  - 3009858221109094
LID - 10.1177/03009858221109094 [doi]
AB  - Endometrial hyperplasia (EH) is a pathologic condition of the uterus with
      increased endometrial gland to stroma ratio compared to normal cyclic uterine
      proliferation. In domestic animals, EH often involves cystic distension of
      proliferating endometrial glands and may be concurrent with pyometra. In large
      captive nondomestic felids, an association between EH and pyometra is common;
      however, detailed species differences between the histological uterine findings
      in lions (Panthera leo) and tigers (Panthera tigris) and clinical manifestations 
      have yet to be described. Uterine sections from 14 lions and 24 tigers with EH
      and/or pyometra were scored for several histological parameters and clinical
      histories were recorded. The percentage of endometrium affected by hyperplasia,
      endometrial gland to stroma ratio, and adenomyosis were significantly (P = .0385,
      P = .0008, and P = .0463, respectively) more severe in lions compared to tigers
      as univariate analytes. Although tubular complexity was not statistically
      significant (P = .3254), when combined as a proposed EH grading scheme, these 4
      features confirmed lions had significantly (P = .0068) more severe EH compared to
      tigers. Endometrial hyperplasia severity significantly correlated with
      inflammation/pyometra severity when controlling for species (P = .0203). A
      significant correlation exists between pyometra-associated clinical sign severity
      and the presence of pyometra in tigers, (P = .0026) but not in lions (P = .1144).
      There was no statistical difference in the severity of clinical signs associated 
      with pyometra between these species (P = .1986). This proposed grading scheme may
      have clinical utility in providing a more consistent and objective evaluation of 
      EH in large captive felids.

AB  - Generalized Langevin equations with non-linear forces and position-dependent
      linear friction memory kernels, such as commonly used to describe the effective
      dynamics of coarse-grained variables in molecular dynamics, are rigorously
      derived within the Mori-Zwanzig formalism. A fluctuation-dissipation theorem
      relating the properties of the noise to the memory kernel is shown. The
      derivation also yields Volterra-type equations for the kernel, which can be used 
      for a numerical parametrization of the model from all-atom simulations.

      Transcranial Alternating Current Stimulation Has No Effect on Visuospatial or

PG  - 903977
LID - 10.3389/fnins.2022.903977 [doi]
AB  - Non-invasive brain stimulation is a growing field with potentially wide-ranging
      clinical and basic science applications due to its ability to transiently and
      safely change brain excitability. In this study we include two types of
      stimulation: repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) and transcranial
      alternating current stimulation (tACS). Single session stimulations with either
      technique have previously been reported to induce changes in attention. To better
      understand and compare the effectiveness of each technique and the basis of their
      effects on cognition we assessed changes to both temporal and visuospatial
      attention using an attentional blink task and a line bisection task following
      offline stimulation with an intermittent theta burst (iTBS) rTMS protocol or 10
      Hz tACS. Additionally, we included a novel rTMS stimulation technique,
      low-intensity (LI-)rTMS, also using an iTBS protocol, which uses stimulation
      intensities an order of magnitude below conventional rTMS. Animal models show
      that low-intensity rTMS modulates cortical excitability despite sub-action
      potential threshold stimulation. Stimulation was delivered in healthy
      participants over the right posterior parietal cortex (rPPC) using a
      within-subjects design (n = 24). Analyses showed no evidence for an effect of any
      stimulation technique on spatial biases in the line bisection task or on
      magnitude of the attentional blink. Our results suggests that rTMS and LI-rTMS
      using iTBS protocol and 10 Hz tACS over rPPC do not modulate performance in tasks
      assessing visuospatial or temporal attention.

TI  - Eye injuries: Understanding ocular trauma.
PG  - 476-482
LID - 10.31128/AJGP-03-21-5921 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ocular trauma may result in pathology of the ocular surface and
      adnexa, extraocular muscles, orbital walls, eye and optic nerve. Detailed history
      followed by a complete ocular and, if indicated, radiological examination is
      therefore a crucial part of any trauma assessment. It is important to determine
      whether a patient with ocular trauma can be reassured or requires immediate
      referral for further investigation and surgical repair. OBJECTIVE: This review
      examines chemical eye injuries, orbital fractures, superficial corneal foreign
      bodies, closed globe injury and suspected open globe injury with or without
      intra-ocular foreign bodies. A structured approach to the history and examination
      is provided. The aim of this article is to enhance clinician confidence when
      encountering these patients. DISCUSSION: Ocular trauma can lead to serious sight 
      and eye-threatening consequences. Accurate history-taking and astute observation 
      are paramount for timely treatment or referral that may prevent blindness. This
      review discusses the management and referral pathways for common presentations of
      ocular trauma.

TI  - Inside the coupling of ladybird beetle elytra: elastic setae can facilitate swift
      deployment.
LID - jeb244343 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jeb.244343 [doi]
AB  - The ladybird beetle (Coccinella septempunctata) is known for swift deployment of 
      its elytra, an action that requires considerable power. However, actuation by
      thoracic muscles alone may be insufficient to deploy elytra at high speed because
      the maximum mechanical power that elytral muscles can produce is only 70% of that
      required for initiation of deployment. Nevertheless, the elytra open rapidly,
      within 3 ms in the initial phase, at a maximum angular velocity of 66.49+/-21.29 
      rad s-1, rivaling the strike velocity of ant lion (Myrmeleon crudelis) mandibles 
      (65+/-21 rad s-1). Here, we hypothesize that elytra coupling may function as an
      energy storage mechanism that facilitates rapid opening by releasing elastic
      strain energy upon deployment. To test this hypothesis and better understand the 
      biomechanics of elytra deployment, we combined micro-computed tomography and
      scanning electron microscopy to examine the microstructure of the coupling of
      paired elytra. We found that two rows of setae on the internal edges of the
      elytra coupling structure undergo elastic deformation when the elytra are locked 
      together. Kinematics observations and mathematical modeling suggest that the
      elastic potential energy stored in the compressed setae generates 40% of the
      power required for deployment of elytra. Our findings broaden insights into how
      ladybirds actuate elytra opening by a strategy of using both muscles and elastic 
      microstructures, and demonstrate a distributed pattern of actuation that adapts
      to geometrical constraints in elytra locking.

TI  - Linear interactions between intraocular, intracranial pressure, and retinal
      vascular pulse amplitude in the fourier domain.
PG  - e0270557
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0270557 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the retinal vascular pulsatile characteristics in subjects
      with normal (ICPn) and high (ICPh) intracranial pressure and quantify the
      interactions between intraocular pressure, intracranial pressure, and retinal
      vascular pulse amplitude in the Fourier domain. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Twenty-one
      subjects were examined using modified photoplethysmography with simultaneous
      ophthalmodynamometry. A harmonic regression model was fitted to each pixel in the
      time-series, and used to quantify the retinal vascular pulse wave parameters
      including the harmonic regression wave amplitude (HRWa). The pulse wave
      attenuation was measured under different ranges of induced intraocular pressure
      (IOPi), as a function of distance along the vessel (VDist). Intracranial pressure
      (ICP) was measured using lumbar puncture. A linear mixed-effects model was used
      to estimate the correlations between the Yeo-Johnson transformed harmonic
      regression wave amplitude (HRWa-YJt) with the predictors (IOPi, VDist and ICP). A
      comparison of the model coefficients was done by calculating the weighted Beta
      (betax) coefficients. RESULTS: The median HRWa in the ICPn group was higher in
      the retinal veins (4.563, interquartile range (IQR) = 3.656) compared to the
      retinal arteries (3.475, IQR = 2.458), p<0.0001. In contrast, the ICPh group
      demonstrated a reduction in the median venous HRWa (3.655, IQR = 3.223) and an
      elevation in the median arterial HRWa (3.616, IQR = 2.715), p<0.0001.
      Interactions of the pulsation amplitude with ICP showed a significant disordinal 
      interaction and the loss of a main effect of the Fourier sine coefficient (bn1)
      in the ICPh group, suggesting that this coefficient reflects the retinal vascular
      response to ICP wave. The linear mixed-effects model (LME) showed the decay in
      the venous (HRWa-YJt) was almost twice that in the retinal arteries
      (-0.067+/-0.002 compared to -0.028+/-0.0021 respectively, p<0.00001). The overall
      interaction models had a total explanatory power of (conditional R2) 38.7%, and
      42% of which the fixed effects explained 8.8%, and 5.8% of the variance (marginal
      R2) for the venous and arterial models respectively. A comparison of the damping 
      effect of VDist and ICP showed that ICP had less influence on pulse decay than
      distance in the retinal arteries (betaICP = -0.21, se = +/-0.017 compared to
      [Formula: see text], se = +/-0.019), whereas the mean value was equal for the
      retinal veins (venous [Formula: see text], se = +/-0.015, betaICP = -0.42, se =
      +/-0.019). CONCLUSION: The retinal vascular pulsation characteristics in the ICPh
      group showed high retinal arterial and low venous pulsation amplitudes.
      Interactions between retinal vascular pulsation amplitude and ICP suggest that
      the Fourier sine coefficient bn1 reflects the retinal vascular response to the
      ICP wave. Although a matrix of regression lines showed high linear
      characteristics, the low model explanatory power precludes its use as a predictor
      of ICP. These results may guide future predictive modelling in non-invasive
      estimation of ICP using modified photoplethysmography.

AB  - Objectives: The aim of this Part I systematic review was to understand the impact
      of the COVID-19 pandemic on the lives of people with dementia living in the
      community or in residential care. Part II focused on unpaid carers.Methods: This 
      review was registered on PROSPERO [CRD42021248050]. Five data bases (PubMed,
      CINAHL, Embase, Scopus, Web of Science) were searched in July 2021. Studies were 
      included if they reported on the impacts of the pandemic on people living with
      dementia, either in the community or residential settings, and published in
      English, German, Polish, or Spanish. Risk of bias was assessed using the Standard
      Quality Assessment QualSyst.Results: Forty papers from 33 studies reported on the
      effects of COVID-19 on people with dementia. Included studies were conducted
      across 15 countries, focusing on single-country evaluations except in one study. 
      Three studies focused on care homes, whilst the remainder reported on the
      community. Studies were categorised into five impacts: Cognition; Independence
      and physical functioning; Behavioural symptoms; Well-being; and Access to care.
      All studies evidenced the negative pandemic impacts, including faster cognitive, 
      physical, and behavioural deterioration, limited access to care, and poorer
      mental and social health.Conclusions: Future restrictions need to consider the
      need for people with dementia to stay cognitively, physically, and socially
      stimulated to live well, and this review provides a call for a future pandemic
      strategy for dementia. Longitudinal research is required on the long-term impacts
      of the pandemic on the lives of people with dementia, including time to care home
      entry.

TI  - INVESTIGATION OF THE USE OF SERUM BIOMARKERS FOR THE DETECTION OF CARDIAC DISEASE
      IN MARINE MAMMALS.
PG  - 373-382
LID - 10.1638/2021-0152 [doi]
AB  - Cardiac disease has been extensively documented in marine mammals; however, it
      remains difficult to diagnose antemortem. Assays measuring cardiac troponin I
      (cTnI) and N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-proBNP) are used as
      sensitive and specific biomarkers of cardiac disease in many species, but have
      not been widely investigated in marine mammals. This study aimed to provide a set
      of reference values for cTnI and NT-proBNP in belugas (BW) (Delphinapterus
      leucas), sea otters (SO) (Enhydra lutris), Steller sea lions (SSL) (Eumetopias
      jubatus), and California sea lions (CSL) (Zalophus californianus) with and
      without cardiac disease, and to determine if these biomarkers are useful
      indicators of cardiac disease in these species. First, existing immunoassays for 
      cTnI and NT-proBNP were successfully validated utilizing species-specific heart
      lysate spiked serum. Cohorts were defined by histopathology as animals with no
      evidence of cardiac disease ("control"), with confirmed cardiac disease
      ("disease"), and with concurrent renal and cardiac disease ("renal") for which
      serum samples were then analyzed. Serum concentration ranges for cTnI (ng/ml) and
      NT-proBNP (pmol/L) were determined for control and disease cohorts. There was
      significantly higher cTnI (P= 0.003) and NT-proBNP (P= 0.004) concentrations in
      the CSL disease cohort, as well as positive trends in BW, SO, and SSL disease
      cohorts that did not reach statistical significance. NT-proBNP concentrations
      were significantly higher in the CSL renal cohort compared with the control (P < 
      0.001) and disease (P= 0.007) cohorts. These results suggest that cTnI and
      NT-proBNP may be clinically useful in the antemortem diagnosis of cardiac disease
      in CSL, and warrant further investigation in BW, SO, and SL.

PG  - 319-330
LID - 10.1638/2021-0072 [doi]
AB  - Capillary zone electrophoresis (CZE) and an immunoassay for serum amyloid A (SAA)
      were used to examine serum samples from clinically normal and abnormal southern
      white rhinoceros (Ceratotherium simum simum) and southern black rhinoceros
      (Diceros bicornis minor) under managed care. CZE resolved seven fractions as well
      as subfractions for alpha1 globulins. Reference intervals were calculated for
      white rhinoceros (n = 33) and found to have some differences over previously
      reported intervals generated using agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE) methods in
      sera from free-ranging animals. In addition, the coefficient of variation related
      to fraction quantitation was found to be overlapping or superior to that reported
      for AGE. No significant differences were observed in CZE measurands and total
      protein between clinically normal and abnormal rhinoceros. In contrast to CZE,
      significant differences in SAA levels (P < 0.001) were observed in samples from
      the white rhinoceros between clinically normal and abnormal animals. In addition,
      in limited sample sets with repeated measures, SAA provided prognostic value.
      Future studies should generate more robust reference intervals and delineate the 
      application of both SAA quantitation and CZE in routine health assessments and in
      prognostication.

TI  - Pediatric Surgical Pulmonary Valve Replacement Outcomes After Implementation of a
      Clinical Pathway.
PG  - 420-425
LID - 10.1177/21501351221098127 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Standardization of perioperative care can reduce resource utilization
      while improving patient outcomes. We sought to describe our outcomes after the
      implementation of a perioperative clinical pathway for pediatric patients
      undergoing elective surgical pulmonary valve replacement and compare these
      results to previously published national benchmarks. METHODS: A retrospective
      single-center descriptive study was conducted of all pediatric patients who
      underwent surgical pulmonary valve replacement from 2017 through 2020, after the 
      implementation of a clinical pathway. Outcomes included hospital length of stay
      and 30-day reintervention, readmission, and mortality. RESULTS: Thirty-three
      patients (55% female, median age 11 [7, 13] years, 32 [23, 44] kg) were included 
      in the study. Most common diagnosis and indication for surgery was Tetralogy of
      Fallot (61%) with pulmonary valve insufficiency (88%). All patients had prior
      cardiac surgery. Median hospital length of stay was 2 [2, 2] days, and longest
      length of stay was three days. There were no 30-day readmissions,
      reinterventions, or mortalities. Median follow-up time was 19 [9, 31] months.
      CONCLUSIONS: Formalization of a perioperative surgical pulmonary valve
      replacement clinical pathway can safely promote short hospital length of stay
      without any short-term readmissions or reinterventions, especially when compared 
      with previously published benchmarks. Such formalization enables the
      dissemination of best practices to other institutions to reduce hospital length
      of stay and limit costs.

AB  - Following previous works about integro-differential equations of parabolic type
      modelling the Darwinian evolution of a population, we study a two-population
      system in the cooperative case. First, we provide a theoretical study of the
      limit of rare mutations and we prove that the limit is described by a constrained
      Hamilton-Jacobi equation. This equation is given by an eigenvalue of a matrix
      which accounts for the diffusion parameters and the coefficients of the system.
      Then, we focus on a particular application: the understanding of a phenomenon
      called Adaptation to DNA damage. In this framework, we provide several numerical 
      simulations to illustrate our theoretical results and investigate mathematical
      and biological questions.

AB  - A division of labor with role specialization is defined as individuals
      specializing in a subtask during repetitions of a group task. While this behavior
      is ubiquitous among humans, there are only four candidates found among
      non-eusocial mammals: lions, mice, chimpanzees, and bottlenose dolphins.
      Bottlenose dolphins in the Cedar Keys, Florida, engage in role specialized
      "driver-barrier feeding", where a "driver" dolphin herds mullet towards "barrier"
      dolphins. Thus trapped, the mullet leap out of the water where the dolphins catch
      them in air. To investigate whether dolphins use acoustic cues or signals to
      coordinate this behavior, vocalizations were recorded before and during
      driver-barrier feeding. Results of fine-scale audio and video analysis during 81 
      events by 7 different driver individuals suggest that barrier animals coordinate 
      movements during these events by cueing on the driver's echolocation. Analysis of
      dolphin whistle occurrence before driving events versus another foraging
      technique, which does not involve role specialization, revealed significantly
      higher whistle production immediately prior to driver-barrier events. Possible
      whistle functions include signaling motivation, recruiting individuals to
      participate, and/or behavioral coordination. While the use of cues and signals is
      common in humans completing role-specialized tasks, this is the first study to
      investigate the use of vocalizations in the coordination of a role-specialized
      behavior in a non-human mammal.

TI  - Sonic Hedgehog Intron Variant Associated With an Unusual Pediatric Cortical
      Cataract.
PG  - 25
LID - 10.1167/iovs.63.6.25 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To identify the genetic basis of an unusual pediatric cortical cataract 
      demonstrating autosomal dominant inheritance in a large European-Australian
      pedigree. Methods: DNA from four affected individuals were exome sequenced
      utilizing a NimbleGen SeqCap EZ Exome V3 kit and HiSeq 2500. DNA from 12 affected
      and four unaffected individuals were genotyped using Human OmniExpress-24
      BeadChips. Multipoint linkage and haplotyping were performed (Superlink-Online
      SNP). DNA from one affected individual and his unaffected father were
      whole-genome sequenced on a HiSeq X Ten system. Rare small insertions/deletions
      and single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) were identified in the disease-linked
      region (Golden Helix SVS). Combined Annotation Dependent Depletion (CADD)
      analysis predicted variant deleteriousness. Putative enhancer function and
      variant effects were determined using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay system.
      Results: Linkage mapping identified a 6.23-centimorgan support interval at
      chromosome 7q36. A co-segregating haplotype refined the critical region to 6.03
      Mbp containing 21 protein-coding genes. Whole-genome sequencing uncovered 114
      noncoding variants from which CADD predicted one was highly deleterious, a novel 
      substitution within intron-1 of the sonic hedgehog signaling molecule (SHH) gene.
      ENCODE data suggested this site was a putative enhancer, subsequently confirmed
      by luciferase reporter assays with variant-associated gene overexpression.
      Conclusions: In a large pedigree, we have identified a SHH intron variant that
      co-segregates with an unusual pediatric cortical cataract phenotype. SHH is
      important for lens formation, and mutations in its receptor (PTCH1) cause
      syndromic cataract. Our data implicate increased function of an enhancer
      important for SHH expression primarily within developing eye tissues.

TI  - The Effect of Estrogen Receptor Status on Survival in Breast Cancer Patients in
      Ethiopia. Retrospective Cohort Study.
PG  - 153-161
LID - 10.2147/BCTT.S365295 [doi]
AB  - Background: There is wide global variance in survival from breast cancer, both in
      developed and developing country. However, the effect of estrogen receptor status
      has not been widely evaluated in Ethiopia where the incidence of breast cancer is
      rapidly increasing. Hence, the current study aimed to determine the effect of
      estrogen receptor status on the overall survival of breast cancer patients who
      were treated at Black Lion Specialized Hospital, Ethiopia. Methods: In this
      institution-based retrospective cohort study a total of 368 study participants
      were included with a one-to-one ratio of estrogen receptor negative to estrogen
      receptor positive. The main outcome of interest for this study was death due to
      breast cancer. The authors compared the women with estrogen receptor-positive and
      estrogen receptor-negative breast cancer for overall survival rate using log rank
      test. The incidence density rate of mortality was calculated for each exposed and
      non-exposed variable. The effect of estrogen receptor status on breast cancer
      mortality was estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model. Results: The
      incidence density rate of mortality among breast cancer patients for estrogen
      receptor positive were found to be 5.48 (95% CI=3.94-7.64) per 1,000 person years
      observation; while for estrogen negative receptor status the mortality rate was
      found to be 10.47 (95% CI=8.19-13.37) per 1,000 person years observation. In the 
      Cox regression analysis after ful adjustments for confounder variables, the
      mortality event risk was 32% higher among estrogen receptor negative (HR=1.32;
      95% CI=1.08-2.91) as compared to estrogen receptor positive breast cancer
      patients. Conclusion: We have found that the incidence density rate of mortality 
      among breast cancer patients was significantly higher in the estrogen receptor
      negative groups. Therefore, clinicians should give careful attention to the
      impact of estrogen receptor negative status on the overall outcome of clients.

TI  - Mice Lacking the Systemic Vitamin A Receptor RBPR2 Show Decreased Ocular
      Retinoids and Loss of Visual Function.
LID - 2371 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14122371 [doi]
AB  - The systemic transport of dietary vitamin A/all-trans retinol bound to RBP4 into 
      peripheral tissues for storage is an essential physiological process that
      continuously provides visual chromophore precursors to the retina under fasting
      conditions. This mechanism is critical for phototransduction, photoreceptor cell 
      maintenance and survival, and in the support of visual function. While the
      membrane receptor STRA6 facilitates the blood transport of lipophilic vitamin A
      into the eye, it is not expressed in most peripheral organs, which are proposed
      to express a second membrane receptor for the uptake of vitamin A from
      circulating RBP4. The discovery of a novel vitamin A receptor, RBPR2, which is
      expressed in the liver and intestine, but not in the eye, alluded to this
      long-sort non-ocular membrane receptor for systemic RBP4-ROL uptake and
      transport. We have previously shown in zebrafish that the retinol-binding protein
      receptor 2 (Rbpr2) plays an important role in the transport of yolk vitamin A to 
      the eye. Mutant rbpr2 zebrafish lines manifested in decreased ocular retinoid
      concentrations and retinal phenotypes. To investigate a physiological role for
      the second vitamin A receptor, RBPR2, in mammals and to analyze the metabolic
      basis of systemic vitamin A transport for retinoid homeostasis, we established a 
      whole-body Rbpr2 knockout mouse (Rbpr2(-/-)) model. These mice were viable on
      both vitamin A-sufficient and -deficient diets. Rbpr2(-/-) mice that were fed a
      vitamin A-sufficient diet displayed lower ocular retinoid levels, decreased
      opsins, and manifested in decrease visual function, as measured by
      electroretinography. Interestingly, when Rbpr2(-/-) mice were fed a vitamin
      A-deficient diet, they additionally showed shorter photoreceptor outer segment
      phenotypes, altogether manifesting in a significant loss of visual function.
      Thus, under conditions replicating vitamin A sufficiency and deficiency, our
      analyses revealed that RBPR2-mediated systemic vitamin A transport is a regulated
      process that is important for vitamin A delivery to the eye when RBP4-bound ROL
      is the only transport pathway in the fasting condition or under vitamin A
      deficiency conditions.

TI  - Corneal Refractive Surgery Considerations in Patients on Dupilumab.
LID - 3273 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11123273 [doi]
AB  - Dupilumab is a biologic approved by the United States Food and Drug
      Administration (US FDA) for the treatment of atopic dermatitis. While it is an
      effective medication for eczema, ocular side effects are common in patients
      receiving dupilumab therapy. Greater consideration is needed when evaluating
      these individuals for corneal refractive surgery. Dupilumab patients may suffer
      from atopy, a condition that also merits consideration in those desiring
      refractive surgery. Additional testing and careful consideration are needed, as
      these patients have an increased risk of dry eye syndrome, keratoconus,
      cataracts, diffuse lamellar keratitis, viral keratitis, and perioperative
      infection. This commentary discusses the current understanding of dupilumab
      ocular side effects and investigates factors to consider when evaluating these
      patients for corneal refractive surgery.

LID - 7464 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19127464 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to investigate the gut microbial genera associated with skeletal
      muscle mass, using a large-scale survey from the standpoint of preventing
      sarcopenia. A total of 848 participants were included in the analysis. The mean
      (SD) ages of men (n = 353) and women (n = 495) were 50.0 (12.9) years and 50.8
      (12.8) years, respectively. Body composition was assessed using appendicular
      skeletal muscle mass/body weight (ASM/BW), ASM, and BW. Additionally, the
      relationship between gut microbial genera and body composition was analyzed. The 
      means (SD) of ASM/BW were 34.9 (2.4) % in men and 29.4 (2.9) % in women. Blautia 
      and Bifidobacterium were positively associated with ASM/BW only in men (Blautia: 
      beta = 0.0003, Bifidobacterium: beta = 0.0001). However, Blautia was negatively
      associated with BW (beta = -0.0017). Eisenbergiella was positively associated
      with ASM/BW (beta = 0.0209) and negatively associated with BW (beta = -0.0769)
      only in women. Our results indicate that Blautia, Bifidobacterium and
      Eisenbergiella, which are positively associated with ASM/BW, might help increase 
      skeletal muscle mass. ASM/BW may clarify the relationship between gut microbiota 
      and skeletal muscle mass without being affected by obesity or excess body fat
      mass.

TI  - Personality as a Predictor of Time-Activity Budget in Lion-Tailed Macaques
      (Macaca silenus).
LID - 1495 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12121495 [doi]
AB  - Time-activity budget, i.e., how a population or an individual divides their day
      into various behaviours and activities, is an important ecological aspect.
      Existing research primarily focused on group-level time-activity budgets, while
      individual variations have only been reported recently. However, little is known 
      about how consistent inter-individual differences or personalities influence
      time-activity budgets. We examined the personalities of lion-tailed macaques
      (Macaca silenus) and investigated their influence on individual time-activity
      budgets. The resulting personality traits, namely persistence, sociability,
      affiliation, and anxiety, were used to predict the three broad categories of the 
      time-activity budget-food-related, active, and resting behaviours. We found that 
      persistence and sociability positively predicted the time spent being active.
      Food-related behaviours were positively predicted by persistence, while anxiety
      was found to influence them negatively. The time spent resting was negatively
      predicted by persistence. We did not find an effect of affiliation on the
      time-activity budgets. We discuss these findings in light of the ecology of
      lion-tailed macaques. Our study highlights the importance of a novel approach
      that uses animal personality traits as predictors of individual time-activity
      budgets and offers insights regarding the use of personality assessments in
      conservation and welfare activities.

TI  - Lipid extraction has tissue-dependent effects on isotopic values (delta(34) S,
      delta(13) C, delta(15) N) from different marine predators.
PG  - e9346
LID - 10.1002/rcm.9346 [doi]
AB  - RATIONALE The use of sulfur isotopes to study trophic ecology in marine
      ecosystems has increased in the last decade. Unlike other commonly used isotopes 
      (e.g., carbon), sulfur can better discriminate benthic and pelagic productivity. 
      However, how lipid extraction affects sulfur isotopic values has not been
      assessed, despite its frequent use to remove lipid effects on delta(13) C values.
      METHODS: We used white muscle and liver samples from two species of sharks and
      skin samples from two species of pinnipeds (sea lion and fur seal) to assess the 
      effects of lipid extraction on stable isotope values for delta(34) S, delta(13)
      C, delta(15) N. Isotopic values were determined by a continuous flow-isotope
      ratio mass spectrometer coupled to an elemental analyser (EA-IRMS). RESULTS:
      Lipid extraction significantly decreased delta(34) S values in shark tissues,
      more so for liver than muscle (-4.6 +/- 0.9 vs -0.8 +/- 0.3 per thousand, average
      change), with nearly no alteration to their standard deviations. Lipid extraction
      did not affect delta(34) S values from pinniped skin samples (0.2 +/- 0.8 per
      thousand, average change). After lipid extraction, consistent increases in
      delta(13) C values (0.2-7.3 per thousand) were detected as expected, especially
      in tissue with high lipid content (C:N > 4). After lipid extraction, significant 
      increases in delta(15) N values (0.5-1.4 per thousand) were found in shark muscle
      and liver tissues. For pinniped skin samples, delta(15) N values were not
      significantly lower after lipid extraction (-0.4 - -0.1 per thousand).
      CONCLUSIONS: Lipid extraction did not have a strong impact on delta(34) S values 
      of shark muscle and pinniped skin (</=1 per thousand). However, our results
      suggest it is essential to consider the effects of lipid extractions when
      interpreting results from delta(34) S values of shark liver tissue, as they
      significantly depleted values relative to bulk tissue (~5 per thousand). This may
      reflect selective removal of sulpholipids and glutathione present in higher
      concentrations in the liver than in muscle and skin and requires further
      investigation.

TI  - A Systematic Review of Clinical Practice Guidelines for Cataract: Evidence to
      Support the Development of the WHO Package of Eye Care Interventions.
LID - 36 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vision6020036 [doi]
AB  - The World Health Organization (WHO) is developing a Package of Eye Care
      Interventions (PECI) to facilitate the integration of eye care into Universal
      Health Coverage. This paper presents the results of a systematic review of
      clinical practice guidelines for cataract in adults, to help inform PECI
      development. We searched academic and guideline databases, and websites of
      professional associations, for guidelines published between January 2010 and
      April 2020. Guidelines were excluded if there was commercial funding or unmanaged
      conflicts of interest. Quality appraisal was conducted using the Appraisal of
      Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II tool. We identified 3778
      reports, 35 related to cataract guidelines, four of which met the inclusion
      criteria (United Kingdom: 2, United States: 1, Iran: 1). The recommendations
      across the four guidelines covered pre-operative (43%), intra-operative (37%),
      and post-operative interventions (20%). Most 'strong' recommendations were
      supported by good quality evidence. Differences in recommendations across
      guidelines may be attributable to time of publication or regional differences in 
      surgical practice. Few guidelines met the quality criteria, and only three
      countries were represented. The results of this step of the PECI development
      process will inform subsequent phases for development of the WHO's package of
      evidence-based eye care interventions for cataract.

TI  - Tuberculosis, an unusual source - a case report.
PG  - 548-552
LID - 10.47626/1679-4435-2021-805 [doi]
AB  - Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by bacteria in the Mycobacterium
      tuberculosis complex. It can affect any organ, but the pulmonary form is the most
      common manifestation. Not only humans can be affected by tuberculosis, and
      animals are also commonly infected. This disease can be transmitted to humans
      usually by inhalation of aerosols or by ingestion of unpasteurized milk or dairy 
      products. We report the case of a zoo worker. He reported an epidemiological
      context of contact with sea lions and dolphins, of which he takes care, with
      tuberculosis in the last 4 months. He sought permanent medical care for a 3-week 
      history of cough, fever, sweating, and weight loss. Bronchial lavage was positive
      for acid-alcohol resistant bacilli. Lavage cultures were positive for the M.
      tuberculosis complex. The patient was referred for treatment with
      antituberculosis drugs. Tuberculosis is a major public health problem worldwide. 
      In the occupational setting, tuberculosis remains a matter of great concern and
      attention, most often in the hospital environment or among health care
      professionals. However, the case reported here shows another, less usual
      occupational setting in which this type of contact can also occur. It is expected
      that the warning of this case can be used by occupational health teams, namely
      those who are responsible for periodic surveillance of workers' health in the
      animal sector.

TI  - Parasites and blood-meal hosts of the tsetse fly in Tanzania: a metagenomics
      study.
PG  - 224
LID - 10.1186/s13071-022-05344-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Tsetse flies can transmit various Trypanosoma spp. that cause
      trypanosomiasis in humans, wild animals, and domestic animals. Amplicon deep
      sequencing of the 12S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene can be used to detect mammalian
      tsetse hosts, and the 18S rRNA gene can be used to detect all associated
      eukaryotic pathogens, including Trypanosoma spp. METHODS: Tsetse flies were
      collected from the Serengeti National Park (n = 48), Maswa Game Reserve (n = 42),
      and Tarangire National Park (n = 49) in Tanzania in 2012-13. Amplicon deep
      sequencing targeting mammal-specific 12S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes was performed to
      screen the blood-feeding sources of tsetse flies and eukaryotic parasites in
      tsetse flies, respectively. RESULTS: 12S rRNA gene deep sequencing revealed that 
      various mammals were blood-feeding sources of the tsetse flies, including humans,
      common warthogs, African buffalos, mice, giraffes, African elephants, waterbucks,
      and lions. Genes of humans were less frequently detected in Serengeti (P =
      0.0024), whereas African buffaloes were detected more frequently as a
      blood-feeding source (P = 0.0010). 18S rRNA gene deep sequencing showed that six 
      tsetse samples harbored the Trypanosoma gene, which was identified as Trypanosoma
      godfreyi and Trypanosoma simiae in subsequent ITS1 gene sequencing. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Through amplicon deep sequencing targeting the 12S rRNA and 18S rRNA genes,
      various mammalian animals were identified as blood-meal sources, and two
      Trypanosoma species were detected in tsetse flies collected from the Maswa Game
      Reserve, Serengeti National Park, and Tarangire National Park in Tanzania. This
      study illustrates the patterns of parasitism of tsetse fly, wild animals targeted
      by the fly, and Trypanosoma spp. carried by the fly in Tanzania. It may provide
      essential data for formulating better strategies to control African trypanosomes.

TI  - Benzimidazole resistant isolates with mutations E198A/V/K in beta-tubulin gene
      possess different fitness and competitive ability in Botrytis cinerea.
LID - 10.1094/PHYTO-04-22-0120-R [doi]
AB  - Previous studies in Botrytis cinerea showed that the resistance to methyl
      benzimidazole carbamates (MBCs) was mainly related to E198A/V/K and F200Y
      mutations of the beta-tubulin gene, and the E198V was the dominant mutation in
      the resistant sub-population in Hubei Province of China, indicating that
      resistant mutation might influence the fitness. However, little is known on the
      effect of each E198A/V/K mutation on fitness. In this study, the fitness and
      competitive ability of isolates with E198A/V/K mutations were investigated.
      Results showed that E198A/V/K isolates and the wild-type isolates shared similar 
      fitness components at virulence, sporulation, conidial germination, oxidative
      sensitivity, sclerotial production and viability. However, slower mycelial growth
      at 4 degrees C, higher sensitivity to 4% NaCl, and increased sclerotial
      production percentage at 4 degrees C were observed in the isolates with E198V,
      E198K, and E198A mutation, respectively. Competitive analysis showed that the
      wild-type sub-population became dominant after three disease cycles in the
      absence of fungicide selection pressure, whereas the resistant sub-population
      seized the space of sensitive sub-population upon MBC application. Unexpectedly, 
      the frequency of E198V isolates decreased dramatically since the first disease
      cycle with or without fungicide selection pressure. These results suggest that
      MBC resistant isolates suffer little fitness penalty, but possess competitive
      disadvantages in the absence of fungicide selection pressure. Under fungicide
      selection pressure, E198V isolates could not compete with E198A/K isolates.
      According to the current results, there was a great possibility that the E198V
      mutation would lose the dominance in the future in China.

AB  - Pathology in the dentate gyrus, including sclerosis, is a hallmark of temporal
      lobe epilepsy, and reduced inhibition to dentate granule cells may contribute to 
      epileptogenesis. The perisomatic-targeting axonal boutons of
      parvalbumin-expressing interneurons decrease in proportion with granule cells in 
      temporal lobe epilepsy. In contrast, dendrite-targeting axonal boutons of
      somatostatin-expressing interneurons sprout exuberantly in temporal lobe
      epilepsy. A third major class of GABAergic interneurons expresses cannabinoid
      receptor type 1 (CB1) on their terminal boutons, but there is conflicting
      evidence as to whether these boutons are increased or decreased in temporal lobe 
      epilepsy. Naturally occurring temporal lobe epilepsy in California sea lions,
      with unilateral or bilateral sclerosis, offers the benefit of neuroanatomy and
      neuropathology akin to humans, but with the advantage that the entirety of both
      hippocampi from control and epileptic brains can be studied. Stereological
      quantification in the dentate gyrus revealed that sclerotic hippocampi from
      epileptic sea lions had fewer CB1-labeled boutons than controls. However, the
      reduction in the number of granule cells was greater, resulting in increased
      CB1-labeled boutons per granule cell in sclerotic hippocampi at temporal levels. 
      This suggests that although CB1-expressing boutons are decreased in sclerotic
      dentate gyri, surviving cells have enhanced innervation from these boutons in
      epileptic sea lions.

TI  - Defining optimal implementation packages for delivering community-wide mass drug 
      administration for soil-transmitted helminths with high coverage.
PG  - 792
LID - 10.1186/s12913-022-08080-5 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent evidence suggests that community-wide mass drug administration
      (MDA) may interrupt the transmission of soil-transmitted helminths (STH), a group
      of intestinal worms that infect 1.5 billion individuals globally. Although
      current operational guidelines provide best practices for effective MDA delivery,
      they do not describe which activities are most essential for achieving high
      coverage or how they work together to produce effective intervention delivery. We
      aimed to identify the various packages of influential intervention delivery
      activities that result in high coverage of community-wide MDA for STH in Benin,
      India, and Malawi. METHODS: We applied coincidence analysis (CNA), a novel
      cross-case analytical method, to process mapping data as part of the
      implementation science research of the DeWorm3 Project, a Hybrid Type 1 cluster
      randomized controlled trial assessing the feasibility of interrupting the
      transmission of STH using bi-annual community-wide MDA in Benin, India, and
      Malawi. Our analysis aimed to identify any necessary and/or sufficient
      combinations of intervention delivery activities (i.e., implementation pathways) 
      that resulted in high MDA coverage. Activities were related to drug supply chain,
      implementer training, community sensitization strategy, intervention duration,
      and implementation context. We used pooled implementation data from three sites
      and six intervention rounds, with study clusters serving as analytical cases (N =
      360). Secondary analyses assessed differences in pathways across sites and over
      intervention rounds. RESULTS: Across all three sites and six intervention rounds,
      efficient duration of MDA delivery (within ten days) singularly emerged as a
      common and fundamental component for achieving high MDA coverage when combined
      with other particular activities, including a conducive implementation context,
      early arrival of albendazole before the planned start of MDA, or a flexible
      community sensitization strategy. No individual activity proved sufficient by
      itself for producing high MDA coverage. We observed four possible overall models 
      that could explain effective MDA delivery strategies, all which included
      efficient duration of MDA delivery as an integral component. CONCLUSION:
      Efficient duration of MDA delivery uniquely stood out as a highly influential
      implementation activity for producing high coverage of community-wide MDA for
      STH. Effective MDA delivery can be achieved with flexible implementation
      strategies that include various combinations of influential intervention
      components.

TI  - Automatic Brain Tumor Classification via Lion Plus Dragonfly Algorithm.
LID - 10.1007/s10278-022-00635-6 [doi]
AB  - Denoising, skull stripping, segmentation, feature extraction, and classification 
      are five important processes in this paper's development of a brain tumor
      classification model. The brain tumor image will be imposed first using the
      entropy-based trilateral filter to de-noising and this image is imposed to skull 
      stripping by means of morphological partition and Otsu thresholding. Adaptive
      contrast limited fuzzy adaptive histogram equalization (CLFAHE) is also used in
      the segmentation process. The gray-level co-occurrence matrix (GLCM)
      characteristics are derived from the segmented image. The collected GLCM features
      are used in a hybrid classifier that combines the neural network (NN) and deep
      belief network (DBN) ideas. As an innovation, the hidden neurons of the two
      classifiers are modified ideally to improve the prediction model's accuracy. The 
      hidden neurons are optimized using a unique hybrid optimization technique known
      as lion with dragonfly separation update (L-DSU), which integrates the approaches
      from both DA and LA. Finally, the suggested model's performance is compared to
      that of the standard models concerning certain performance measures.

TI  - Nasopulmonary mites (Acari: Halarachnidae) as potential vectors of bacterial
      pathogens, including Streptococcus phocae, in marine mammals.
PG  - e0270009
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0270009 [doi]
AB  - Nasopulmonary mites (NPMs) of the family Halarachnidae are obligate endoparasites
      that colonize the respiratory tracts of mammals. NPMs damage surface epithelium
      resulting in mucosal irritation, respiratory illness, and secondary infection,
      yet the role of NPMs in facilitating pathogen invasion or dissemination between
      hosts remains unclear. Using 16S rRNA massively parallel amplicon sequencing of
      six hypervariable regions (or "16S profiling"), we characterized the bacterial
      community of NPMs from 4 southern sea otters (Enhydra lutris nereis). This data
      was paired with detection of a priority pathogen, Streptococcus phocae, from NPMs
      infesting 16 southern sea otters and 9 California sea lions (Zalophus
      californianus) using nested conventional polymerase chain reaction (nPCR). The
      bacteriome of assessed NPMs was dominated by Mycoplasmataceae and Vibrionaceae,
      but at least 16 organisms with pathogenic potential were detected as well.
      Importantly, S. phocae was detected in 37% of NPM by nPCR and was also detected
      by 16S profiling. Detection of multiple organisms with pathogenic potential in or
      on NPMs suggests they may act as mechanical vectors of bacterial infection for
      marine mammals.

TI  - Mother-pup recognition mechanisms in Australia sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) using 
      uni- and multi-modal approaches.
LID - 10.1007/s10071-022-01641-5 [doi]
AB  - Communication is the process by which one emitter conveys information to one or
      several receivers to induce a response (behavioral or physiological) by the
      receiver. Communication plays a major role in various biological functions and
      may involve signals and cues from different sensory modalities. Traditionally,
      investigations of animal communication focused on a single sensory modality, yet 
      communication is often multimodal. As these different processes may be quite
      complex and therefore difficult to disentangle, one approach is to first study
      each sensorial modality separately. With this refined understanding of individual
      senses, revealing how they interact becomes possible as the characteristics and
      properties of each modality can be accounted for, making a multimodal approach
      feasible. Using this framework, researchers undertook systematic, experimental
      investigations on mother-pup recognition processes in a colonial pinniped
      species, the Australian sea lion Neophoca cinerea. The research first assessed
      the abilities of mothers and pups to identify each other by their voice using
      playback experiments. Second, they assessed whether visual cues are used by both 
      mothers and pups to distinguish them from conspecifics, and/or whether females
      discriminate the odor of their filial pup from those from non-filial pups.
      Finally, to understand if the information transmitted by different sensory
      modalities is analyzed synergistically or if there is a hierarchy among the
      sensory modalities, experiments were performed involving different sensory cues
      simultaneously. These findings are discussed with regards to the active space of 
      each sensory cue, and of the potential enhancements that may arise by assessing
      information from different modalities.

TI  - Role of corneal biopsy in the management of infectious keratitis.
PG  - 290-295
LID - 10.1097/ICU.0000000000000852 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: The aim of this study was to review the existing literature
      and investigate the role of microbiologic culture and histopathologic examination
      of corneal biopsies in the management of infectious keratitis. RECENT FINDINGS:
      Corneal biopsy continues to be a significantly useful tool in the diagnosis and
      tailored management of infectious keratitis. Several techniques can be employed
      for tissue collection, handling and processing to optimize diagnostic yield and
      maximize safety, including emerging femtosecond laser-assisted biopsy. SUMMARY:
      Corneal opacities represent a significant cause of global blindness, and
      infectious keratitis is the most common cause. Organism identification in
      progressive infectious keratitis is essential for proper management. However,
      microbiological culture alone has a high rate of false-negative results. Records 
      from the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute were retrospectively searched for patients
      between 1 January 2015, and 31 December 2019, who underwent corneal biopsy,
      therapeutic keratoplasty or endothelial graft removal for infectious keratitis
      and had specimens bisected and submitted for evaluation with both microbiologic
      culture and histopathologic examination. Detection of bacteria, fungus and
      mycobacteria was not statistically different between culture and histopathology. 
      Microbiology and histopathology are complementary methods for the identification 
      of causative microorganisms in corneal specimens with presumed infectious
      keratitis.

TI  - Comparison of Local and Systemic Inflammation During Invasive Versus Noninvasive 
      Ventilation in Rats.
PG  - 343-348
LID - 10.1089/jir.2022.0040 [doi]
AB  - The impact of noninvasive ventilation (NIV) on local and systemic inflammation is
      poorly characterized, particularly when compared with invasive mechanical
      ventilation (IMV). We sought to quantify the local and systemic inflammatory
      response of these 2 respiratory treatments in rats with lipopolysaccharide
      (LPS)-induced lung injury (LPS-injured) and healthy rats. Animals were subjected 
      to 4 h of NIV or IMV treatments at noninjurious settings, or 4 h of control
      treatment in which healthy or LPS-injured animals remained spontaneously
      breathing under isoflurane anesthesia with no respiratory support. Cytokines were
      then quantified in the serum and lung tissue by multiplex enzyme-linked
      immunosorbent assay. Contrary to our hypothesis, there were no significant
      differences in cytokine levels in serum or lung when comparing the NIV- and
      IMV-treated groups; this was true in both LPS-injured and healthy rats. However, 
      within the LPS-injured group, pulmonary levels of interleukin (IL)-1alpha, IL-6, 
      and tumor necrosis factor alpha were significantly lower in the NIV-treated group
      than in control but not in the IMV-treated group compared with control. We
      conclude that NIV, unlike IMV, could attenuate local inflammation.

TI  - ISOLATION, CHARACTERIZATION, AND ANTIMICROBIAL SUSCEPTIBILITY OF BACTERIA
      ISOLATED FROM SEA LION (ZALOPHUS CALIFORNIANUS) PUPS IN NORTHWESTERN MEXICO.
PG  - 500-511
LID - 10.7589/JWD-D-21-00183 [doi]
AB  - Bacterial infections have been documented in marine mammals for decades, and some
      are considered emerging pathogens with zoonotic potential. The aerobic oral
      (n=16) and rectal (n=17) bacterial microbiota and their antimicrobial resistance 
      were characterized for 17 apparently healthy California sea lion pups (Zalophus
      californianus) captured with a hoop net in Farallon Island, Sinaloa, Mexico, in
      2016. Bacteriologic cultures, Analytical Profile Index, and PCR were used to
      identify bacterial species. The Escherichia coli phylogenetic groups were
      identified by PCR, Salmonella serotypes were identified, and resistance to
      antibiotics was evaluated. Overall, 39 bacterial species were isolated, including
      E. coli and Salmonella spp. (35.9% each) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (28.2%). For 
      E. coli, UNKNOWN phylogroup was the most prevalent (57.7%), followed by the A
      phylogroup (37.1%). Most Salmonella serotypes were identified as Newport (92.8%);
      serotype Saintpaul was also identified (7.2%). Sea lions with bacterial
      co-colonization included 24.2%, from which two bacterial species were isolated,
      and 3% with three species. Overall, 59% of bacteria were resistant to at least
      one antibiotic tested, and 25.6% were extensively drug resistant. Bacteria were
      highly resistant to ampicillin and cefotaxime. This study demonstrates the
      importance of characterizing the microbiome of sea lions, and the potential
      effect of pathogens with antimicrobial resistance on wildlife conservation and
      public health.

TI  - Axial Length Distributions in Patients With Genetically Confirmed Inherited
      Retinal Diseases.
PG  - 15
LID - 10.1167/iovs.63.6.15 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: We investigated axial length (AL) distributions in inherited retinal
      diseases (IRDs), comparing them with reference cohorts. Methods: AL measurements 
      from IRD natural history study participants were included and compared with
      reference cohorts (TwinsUK, Raine Study Gen2-20, and published studies).
      Comparing with the Raine Study cohort, formal odds ratios (ORs) for AL >/= 26 mm 
      or AL </= 22 mm were derived for each IRD (Firth's logistic regression model,
      adjusted for age and sex). Results: Measurements were available for 435 patients 
      (median age, 19.5 years). Of 19 diseases, 10 had >10 participants: ABCA4
      retinopathy; CNGB3- and CNGA3-associated achromatopsia; RPGR-associated disease; 
      RPE65-associated disease; blue cone monochromacy (BCM); Bornholm eye disease
      (BED); TYR- and OCA2-associated oculocutaneous albinism; and GPR143-associated
      ocular albinism. Compared with the TwinsUK cohort (n = 322; median age, 65.1
      years) and Raine Study cohort (n = 1335; median age, 19.9 years), AL
      distributions were wider in the IRD groups. Increased odds for longer ALs were
      observed for BCM, BED, RPGR, RPE65, OCA2, and TYR; increased odds for short AL
      were observed for RPE65, TYR, and GPR143. In subanalysis of RPGR-associated
      disease, longer average ALs occurred in cone-rod dystrophy (n = 5) than rod-cone 
      dystrophy (P = 0.002). Conclusions: Several diseases showed increased odds for
      longer AL (highest OR with BCM); some showed increased odds for shorter AL
      (highest OR with GPR143). Patients with RPE65- and TYR-associated disease showed 
      increased odds for longer and for shorter eyes. Albinism genes were associated
      with different effects on AL. These findings add to the phenotype of IRDs and may
      yield insights into mechanisms of refractive error development.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) rating scale is frequently
      used to assess cognitive impairments in amnestic mild cognitive impairment (aMCI)
      and Alzheimer's disease (AD). OBJECTIVES: The aims of this study were to a)
      evaluate the construct validity of the MoCA and its subdomains or whether the
      MoCA can be improved by feature reduction, and b) develop a short version of the 
      MoCA (MoCA-Brief) for the Thai population. METHODS: We recruited 181
      participants, namely 60 healthy controls, 61 aMCI, and 60 AD patients. RESULTS:
      The construct reliability of the original MoCA was not optimal and could be
      improved by deleting one subdomain (Naming) and five items, namely Clock Circle, 
      Lion, Digit Forward, Repeat 2nd Sentence, and Place, which showed inadequate
      loadings on their latent vectors. To construct the MoCA-Brief, the reduced model 
      underwent further reduction and feature selection based on model quality data of 
      the outer models. We produced a MoCA-Brief rating scale comprising five items,
      namely Clock Time, Subtract 7, Fluency, Month, and Year. The first latent vector 
      extracted from these five indicators showed adequate construct validity with an
      Average Variance Extracted of 0.599, composite reliability of 0.822, Cronbach's
      alpha of 0.832 and rho A of 0.833. The MoCA-Brief factor score showed a strong
      correlation with the total MoCA score (r = 0.98, p < 0.001) and shows adequate
      concurrent, test-retest, and inter-rater validity. CONCLUSION: The construct
      validity of the MoCA may be improved by deleting five items. The new MoCA-Brief
      rating scale deserves validation in independent samples and especially in other
      countries.

AB  - Background: Little is known regarding the severity of anxiety and depression
      among palliative care patients with cancer. As a result, this study aimed to
      assess the magnitude of anxiety and depression and its associated factors among
      palliative care patients with cancer. Methods: A cross-sectional study was
      conducted at the Black Lion Specialized Hospital oncology center on palliative
      care patients with cancer who had follow up. Interviews and chart reviews were
      used. Descriptive statistics and Chi-square were done. Multivariate analysis was 
      done. Result: A total of 171 palliative care patients with cancer were involved
      in the study. The magnitude of anxiety and depression was found at 64.9% and
      47.4%, respectively. Those palliative care patients with cancer whose age >64
      years (AOR: 7.1; CI: 1.59-68.0; P =0.029), unable to write and read (AOR: 0.2;
      CI: 0.03-0.73; P = 0.017), secondary school (AOR: 0.3; CI: 0.11-0.83; P = 0.022) 
      were significant factors for anxiety. Breast cancer (AOR: 0.1; CI: 0.01-0.85; P =
      0.021), surgery plus radiation (AOR: 0.2; CI: 0.02-0.91: P=0.024) others
      (radiation and surgery (AOR: 0.1; CI: 0.02-0.8: P = 0.036) were found to be
      significant factors for depression. Conclusion: The magnitude of anxiety and
      depression was 64.9% and 47.4%, respectively. Greater than 64-year-old age,
      unable to write and read secondary school were significant factors for anxiety.
      Breast cancer, surgery plus radiation, others (radiation and surgery) were found 
      to be significant factors for depression.

TI  - Robust control strategy by the Sterile Insect Technique for reducing
      epidemiological risk in presence of vector migration.

LID - S0025-5564(22)00059-1 [pii]

AB  - The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) is a promising technique to control
      mosquitoes, vectors of diseases, like dengue, chikungunya or Zika. However, its
      application in the field is not easy, and its success hinges upon several
      constraints, one of them being that the treated area must be sufficiently
      isolated to limit migration or re-invasion by mosquitoes from the outside. In
      this manuscript we study the impact of males and (fertile) females migration on
      SIT. We show that a critical release rate for sterile males exists for every
      migration level, in the context of continuous or periodic releases. In
      particular, when (fertile) females migration is sufficiently low, then SIT can be
      conducted successfully using either open-loop control or closed-loop control (or 
      a combination of both methods) when regular measurements of the wild population
      are completed. Numerical simulations to illustrate our theoretical results are
      presented and discussed. Finally, we derive a threshold value for the females
      migration rate, when viruses are circulating, under which it is possible to lower
      the epidemiological risk in the treated area, according to the size of the human 
      population.

AB  - Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is the most common inherited polyneuropathy,
      with a characteristic phenotype of distal muscle weakness, atrophy, and sensory
      loss. Variable ocular involvement has been documented in patients with CMT, with 
      optic atrophy as the most frequently reported symptom. Although the
      Charcot-Marie-Tooth Association has generally deemed laser-assisted in situ
      keratomileuses (LASIK) a safe option for patients with CMT, reports of corneal
      refractive surgery are lacking in this patient population. This commentary
      discusses the current understanding of CMT, including its ocular manifestations, 
      and additional specific testing to consider when evaluating these patients for
      corneal refractive surgery.

TI  - The Laparoscopic Implantation of Neuroprosthesis Procedure Increases Leg Lean
      Mass in Individuals With Paraplegia Due To Traumatic Spinal Cord Injury.
LID - S1094-7159(22)00680-8 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.neurom.2022.04.044 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We hypothesized that the laparoscopic implantation of neuroprosthesis
      (LION) procedure would significantly alter the body composition of patients with 
      chronic traumatic spinal cord injury (SCI). The objectives were to determine the 
      effect of the LION procedure on lean mass (LM), fatty mass (FM), and bone mineral
      content (BMC) in patients with SCI. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Five consecutive
      patients underwent dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry scans before the LION
      procedure and at the one-year postoperative follow-up to determine changes in LM,
      FM, and BMC. Student paired t-test was used to determine significance. RESULTS:
      The patients gained 2506 +/- 565 g of LM in the legs (p < 0.001), which was an
      18% total increase in leg LM. Total body LM was significantly increased by 3523
      +/- 1048 g (p < 0.003). FM was unaffected, whereas total BMC showed a small but
      significant increase of 99 +/- 42 g (p = 0.009). CONCLUSIONS: The LION procedure 
      and subsequent neurostimulation procedures resulted in substantial increases in
      leg LM in patients with chronic traumatic SCI and paraplegia. A possible
      incremental effect on total BMC also was observed. Further studies are needed to 
      confirm and expand these promising results.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether severity of periorbital necrotizing fasciitis can
      be predicted based on premorbid patient characteristics. METHODS: Records of 10
      consecutive patients with periorbital necrotizing fasciitis presenting at a
      single center, treated by one attending ophthalmic plastic surgeon, were
      retrospectively reviewed. Demographic information and medical history were used
      to determine a Charlson Comorbidity Index (CCI) score for each patient. Other
      variables included presenting visual acuity, number of surgical debridements
      performed, infectious organism (if known), and visual acuity at last follow-up.
      Data were compared with Mann-Whitney U test to determine correlation between
      variables, using p-values as outcome measures. RESULTS: Increased age at
      presentation correlated with worse presenting and final visual acuity, requiring 
      more surgical debridements to control disease (each p < .0001). Worse initial
      visual acuity correlated with need for increased number of debridements (p =
      .002), but increased number of debridements did not correlate with final visual
      acuity (p = .101). CCI did not correlate with initial vision (p = .30), final
      vision (p = .72), or number of surgical debridements necessary (p = .99).
      Presenting visual acuity did not correlate with final visual acuity (p = .268).
      CONCLUSION: Older patients have more severe cases of periorbital necrotizing
      fasciitis, as defined by increased number of surgeries required to control
      disease and worse visual outcomes. CCI did not correlate with severity of
      disease.

TI  - Retention in Community Health Screening among Taiwanese Adults: A 9-Year
      Prospective Cohort Study.
LID - 6813 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijerph19116813 [doi]
AB  - Largely conducted in Western developed nations, research on community health
      screening has mainly been of limited duration. This study aims to ascertain the
      predictors of retention in a community health screening program, involving
      multiple admission cohorts over a 9-year period in Taiwan. Retention is defined
      as the participation in subsequent waves of health screening after being
      recruited for an initial screening. Data came from a prospective cohort study,
      named "Landseed Integrated Outreaching Neighborhood Screening (LIONS)", in
      Taiwan. This research retrieved 5901 community-dwelling Taiwanese adults aged 30 
      and over from LIONS and examined their retention in three follow-ups during
      2006-2014. Generalized estimating equations were employed to evaluate retention
      over time as a function of social determinants, health behaviors, and health
      conditions. Being middle-aged, higher education, and regular exercise were
      positively associated with retention. Conversely, smoking, betel-nut chewing,
      psychiatric disorder, hypertension, type 2 diabetes mellitus, stroke, and a
      longer time interval since enrollment were negatively associated with retention. 
      Furthermore, retention rates varied substantially across admission cohorts with
      more recent cohorts having a lower rate of retention (aOR = 0.33-0.83). Greater
      attention needs to be directed to retention over time and variations across
      admission cohorts. Additionally, those who are in either younger or older age
      groups and have chronic diseases or unhealthy behaviors should be targeted with
      greater efforts.

TI  - Current State of In Vitro Embryo Production in African Lion (Panthera leo).
LID - 1424 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12111424 [doi]
AB  - In the last 30-40 years, in vitro maturation (IVM) and fertilization (IVF) of
      domestic cat oocytes have been established as part of the panel of assisted
      reproduction technologies. As a representative of wild felids, the African lion
      is not yet considered endangered. Nevertheless, the zoo population management of 
      the African lion itself as well as other closely related felids would benefit
      from the establishment of an IVF system. Here, we aimed to investigate the
      transferability of domestic cat IVF technology to the African lion. From the
      ovaries of 42 lionesses aged between 0.75 and 15 years, a total of 933
      IVF-suitable oocytes were retrieved and subjected to IVM and IVF. The overall
      maturation rate was 40.6% and 18.9% of these oocytes cleaved after fertilization,
      respectively. Embryos were generated by intracytoplasmic sperm cell injection as 
      well as co-culture with epididymal sperm. Improvements in the model system also
      led to an improved outcome with in vitro produced embryos in the lion. Compared
      to domestic cats, the transportation of gonads to a specialized laboratory was
      time-consuming and influenced oocyte quality negatively. In conclusion, the
      domestic cat IVF system is adoptable for the African lion, although success rates
      are still lower.

AB  - Similar to the several pinniped and a few terrestrial carnivore species, the
      Steller sea lion has a seasonal synchronized mating scheme enabled by a female
      reproductive cycle that includes embryonic diapause, delayed implantation, and
      pseudopregnancy (a state in which the corpus luteum produces progesterone for
      approximately as long as in pregnant females). Due to this, circulating systemic 
      progesterone concentrations cannot be used to differentiate pregnant and
      nonpregnant females during early gestation. With the use of advanced measurement 
      technologies such as liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS)
      additional steroid hormones are measurable which can provide additional
      information on the endocrine pathways throughout gestation. Our objectives were
      to further characterize endocrine patterns in female Steller sea lion pregnancy
      by 1) quantifying longitudinal profiles of hormone metabolites in pregnant and
      non-pregnant female sera, and 2) evaluating hormone profiles to identify pregnant
      animals within the early stage of gestation. Three gestation stages were
      delineated based on what is believed to be the period of implantation
      (September-October): EARLY (August- November), MID (December-February), and LATE 
      (March to May). Five steroids, Progesterone (P4), 5alpha-dihydroprogesterone
      (DHP), 17alphaOH-progesterone (17OHP), 20alphaOH-progesterone (20OHP), and
      androstenedione (A4), were detected in both pregnant and non-pregnant animals. A 
      significant difference in P4 concentrations was measured between EARLY and MID
      gestation (p </= 0.01) in both pregnant and non-pregnant animals. During MID
      gestation there was a significant difference (p </= 0.05) between pregnant and
      non-pregnant animals in all pregnanes measured. Significant patterns of
      correlation between P4 and 17OHP and between P4 and DHP were detected during
      EARLY and MID gestation in non-pregnant animals. While those significant
      correlations also exist in EARLY pregnant animals, this pattern was lost by MID
      gestation. This loss of correlation suggests a potential shift in progesterone
      metabolism from ovarian to alternative tissue (e.g. fetal gonads or adrenal
      glands) by MID gestation in Steller sea lions. We were unable to identifying a
      steroid hormone biomarker capable of differentiating pseudopregnancy from
      pregnant animals and conclude that such a biomarker likely falls outside of the
      traditional progesterone metabolic pathway.

TI  - Impact of BCR::ABL1 transcript type on RT-qPCR amplification performance and
      molecular response to therapy.
PG  - 1879-1886
LID - 10.1038/s41375-022-01612-2 [doi]
AB  - Several studies have reported that chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML) patients
      expressing e14a2 BCR::ABL1 have a faster molecular response to therapy compared
      to patients expressing e13a2. To explore the reason for this difference we
      undertook a detailed technical comparison of the commonly used Europe Against
      Cancer (EAC) BCR::ABL1 reverse transcriptase quantitative polymerase chain
      reaction (RT-qPCR) assay in European Treatment and Outcome Study (EUTOS)
      reference laboratories (n = 10). We found the amplification ratio of the e13a2
      amplicon was 38% greater than e14a2 (p = 0.015), and the amplification efficiency
      was 2% greater (P = 0.17). This subtle difference led to measurable
      transcript-type dependent variation in estimates of residual disease which could 
      be corrected by (i) taking the qPCR amplification efficiency into account, (ii)
      using alternative RT-qPCR approaches or (iii) droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), a
      technique which is relatively insensitive to differences in amplification
      kinetics. In CML patients, higher levels of BCR::ABL1/GUSB were identified at
      diagnosis for patients expressing e13a2 (n = 67) compared to e14a2 (n = 78) when 
      analysed by RT-qPCR (P = 0.0005) but not ddPCR (P = 0.5). These data indicate
      that widely used RT-qPCR assays result in subtly different estimates of disease
      depending on BCR::ABL1 transcript type; these differences are small but may need 
      to be considered for optimal patient management.

TI  - How Did the COVID-19 Restrictions Impact People Living With Dementia and Their
      Informal Carers Within Community and Residential Aged Care Settings in Australia?
      A Qualitative Study.
PG  - 205-218
LID - 10.1177/10748407221101638 [doi]
AB  - The aim of this study was to explore how formal social support changed after
      implementation of the COVID-19 public health measures and how these restrictions 
      affected people living with dementia and their informal carers in Australia.
      Sixteen informal carers and two people living with dementia were interviewed
      between August and November 2020. Participants were asked about their experiences
      of the pandemic and the impact that the restrictions had on their lives and care.
      Thematic analysis identified four overarching themes describing (a) prepandemic
      limitations of the aged care system, (b) the aged care system's response to the
      COVID-19 restrictions, (c) changes affecting informal carers, and (d) the
      challenges faced by people living with dementia. The findings highlighted the
      challenges faced by the Australian aged care system before the pandemic and the
      additional burden placed on informal carers who supported people living with
      dementia across residential and home settings during the pandemic.

TI  - A novel C-domain-dependent inhibition of the rainbow trout CMP-sialic acid
      synthetase activity by CMP-deaminoneuraminic acid.
PG  - 16-21

AB  - The CMP-sialic acid synthetase (CSS) activates free sialic acid (Sia) to CMP-Sia 
      using CTP, and is prerequisite for the sialylation of cell surface
      glycoconjugates. The vertebrate CSS consists of two domains, a catalytic N-domain
      and a non-catalytic C-domain. Although the C-domain is not required for the CSS
      enzyme to synthesize CMP-Sia, its involvement in the catalytic activity remains
      unknown. First, the real-time monitoring of CSS-catalyzed reaction was performed 
      by (31)P NMR using the rainbow trout CSS (rtCSS). While a rtCSS lacking the
      C-domain (rtCSS-N) similarly activated both deaminoneuraminic acid (Kdn) and
      N-acetylneuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), the full-length rtCSS (rtCSS-FL) did not
      activate Kdn as efficiently as Neu5Ac. These results suggest that the C-domain of
      rtCSS affects the enzymatic activity, when Kdn was used as a substrate. Second,
      the enzymatic activity of rtCSS-FL and rtCSS-N was measured under various
      concentrations of CMP-Kdn. Inhibition by CMP-Kdn was observed only for rtCSS-FL, 
      but not for rtCSS-N, suggesting that the inhibition was C-domain-dependent.
      Third, the inhibitory effect of CMP-Kdn was also investigated using the mouse CSS
      (mCSS). However, no inhibition was observed with mCSS even at high concentrations
      of CMP-Kdn. Taken together, the data demonstrated that the C-domain is involved
      in the CMP-Kdn-dependent inhibition of rtCSS, which is a novel regulation of the 
      Sia metabolism in rainbow trout.

TI  - EVALUATION OF TRACE ELEMENT CONCENTRATIONS IN THE SERUM AND VIBRISSAE OF PERUVIAN
      PINNIPEDS (ARCTOCEPHALUS AUSTRALIS AND OTARIA BYRONIA).
PG  - 608-620
LID - 10.7589/JWD-D-21-00104 [doi]
AB  - Concentrations of 15 trace elements (aluminum, arsenic, cadmium, chromium,
      cobalt, copper, iron, lead, manganese, mercury, nickel, selenium, tin, vanadium, 
      and zinc) were determined in vibrissae (whiskers) and serum of two sympatric
      pinniped species, the Peruvian fur seal population (PFS; Arctocephalus australis 
      Peruvian subpopulation) and South American sea lion (SASL; Otaria byronia) at
      Punta San Juan, Peru during 2011-19 sampling events. Element concentrations were 
      2-20 times higher in vibrissae than in serum. Vibrissae and serum concentrations 
      of several elements, including aluminum, arsenic, and lead, suggest that
      environmental contaminants may affect the health of pinnipeds at Punta San Juan. 
      Although toxicity thresholds are unknown in pinnipeds, high concentrations of
      some elements (especially aluminum, arsenic, and lead) may have adverse impacts
      on their health such as immunosuppression and impaired reproduction. Arsenic was 
      the only element that increased in mean vibrissae concentration throughout the
      study period. Female SASL vibrissae contained a mean arsenic concentration three 
      times higher than the male SASL vibrissae mean arsenic concentration, and twice
      as high as the arsenic mean for all PFS vibrissae. The mean male SASL vibrissae
      cadmium concentration was five times higher than the vibrissae cadmium mean for
      both PFS males and females and nearly three times higher than the vibrissae
      cadmium mean for SASL females. Serum concentrations of aluminum, arsenic, copper,
      and manganese were significantly higher during moderate to extreme El Nino years 
      compared to La Nina years. With stronger and more frequent El Nino-Southern
      Oscillation events predicted in the future, it is vital to understand how these
      trace elements may affect pinniped population health.

AB  - Deciphering the effects of historical and recent demographic processes
      responsible for the spatial patterns of genetic diversity and structure is a key 
      objective in evolutionary and conservation biology. Using population genetic
      analyses, we investigated the demographic history, the contemporary genetic
      diversity and structure, and the occurrence of hybridization and introgression of
      two species of anadromous fish with contrasting life history strategies and which
      have undergone recent demographic declines, the allis shad (Alosa alosa) and the 
      twaite shad (Alosa fallax). We genotyped 706 individuals from 20 rivers and 5
      sites at sea in Southern Europe at thirteen microsatellite markers. Genetic
      structure between populations was lower for the nearly semelparous species A.
      alosa, which disperses greater distances compared to the iteroparous species, A. 
      fallax. Individuals caught at sea were assigned at the river level for A. fallax 
      and at the region level for A. alosa. Using an approximate Bayesian computation
      framework, we inferred that the most likely long term historical divergence
      scenario between both species and lineages involved historical separation
      followed by secondary contact accompanied by strong population size decline.
      Accordingly, we found evidence for contemporary hybridization and bidirectional
      introgression due to gene flow between both species and lineages. Moreover, our
      results support the existence of at least one distinct species in the
      Mediterrannean sea: A. agone in Golfe du Lion area, and another divergent lineage
      in Corsica. Overall, our results shed light on the interplay between historical
      and recent demographic processes and life history strategies in shaping
      population genetic diversity and structure of closely related species. The recent
      demographic decline of these species' populations and their hybridization should 
      be carefully considered while implementing conservation programs.

AB  - Most natural ecosystems contain animals feeding on many different types of food, 
      but it is difficult to predict what will be eaten when food availabilities
      change. We present a method that estimates food preference over many study sites,
      even when number of food types vary widely from site to site. Sampling variation 
      is estimated using bootstrapping. We test the precision and accuracy of this
      method using computer simulations that show the effects of overall number of food
      types, number of sites, and proportion of missing prey items per site. Accuracy
      is greater with fewer missing prey types, more prey types and more sites, and is 
      affected by the number of sites more than the number of prey types. We present a 
      case study using lion (Panthera leo) feeding data and show that preference vs
      prey size follows a bell-curve. Using just two estimated parameters, this curve
      can be used as a general way to describe predator feeding patterns. Our method
      can be used to: test hypotheses about what factors affect prey selection, predict
      preferences in new sites, and estimate overall prey consumed in new sites.

LID - 10.1111/evo.14522 [doi]
AB  - What is the influence of periodic environmental fluctuations on life-history
      evolution? We present a general theoretical framework to understand and predict
      the long-term evolution of life-history traits under a broad range of ecological 
      scenarios. Specifically, we investigate how periodic fluctuations affect
      selection when the population is also structured in distinct classes. This
      analysis yields time-varying selection gradients that clarify the influence of
      the fluctuations of the environment on the competitive ability of a specific
      life-history mutation. We use this framework to analyse the evolution of key
      life-history traits of pathogens. We examine three different epidemiological
      scenarios and we show how periodic fluctuations of the environment can affect the
      evolution of virulence and transmission as well as the preference for different
      hosts. These examples yield new and testable predictions on pathogen evolution,
      and illustrate how our approach can provide a better understanding of the
      evolutionary consequences of time-varying environmental fluctuations in a broad
      range of scenarios.

TI  - Endothelial extracellular vesicles promote tumour growth by tumour-associated
      macrophage reprogramming.
PG  - e12228
LID - 10.1002/jev2.12228 [doi]
AB  - Tumour-derived extracellular vesicles (EVs) participate in tumour progression by 
      deregulating various physiological processes including angiogenesis and
      inflammation. Here we report that EVs released by endothelial cells in a mammary 
      tumour environment participate in the recruitment of macrophages within the
      tumour, leading to an immunomodulatory phenotype permissive for tumour growth.
      Using RNA-Seq approaches, we identified several microRNAs (miRNAs) found in
      endothelial EVs sharing common targets involved in the regulation of the immune
      system. To further study the impact of these miRNAs in a mouse tumour model, we
      focused on three miRNAs that are conserved between humans and mouse, that is,
      miR-142-5p, miR-183-5p and miR-222-3p. These miRNAs are released from endothelial
      cells in a tumour microenvironment and are transferred via EVs to macrophages. In
      mouse mammary tumour models, treatment with EVs enriched in these miRNAs leads to
      a polarization of macrophages toward an M2-like phenotype, which in turn promotes
      tumour growth.

TI  - The Legacy of the TTASAAN Report - Premature Conclusions and Forgotten Promises
      About SPECT Neuroimaging: A Review of Policy and Practice Part II.
PG  - 851609
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2022.851609 [doi]
AB  - Brain perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans were
      initially developed in 1970s. A key radiopharmaceutical, hexamethylpropyleneamine
      oxime (HMPAO), was not stabilized until 1993 and most early SPECT scans were
      performed on single-head gamma cameras. These early scans were of inferior
      quality. In 1996, the Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee of the 
      American Academy of Neurology (TTASAAN) issued a report regarding the use of
      SPECT in the evaluation of neurological disorders. This two-part series explores 
      the policies and procedures related to perfusion SPECT functional neuroimaging.
      In Part I, the comparison between the quality of the SPECT scans and the depth of
      the data for key neurological and psychiatric indications at the time of the
      TTASAAN report vs. the intervening 25 years were presented. In Part II, the
      technical aspects of perfusion SPECT neuroimaging and image processing will be
      explored. The role of color scales will be reviewed and the process of
      interpreting a SPECT scan will be presented. Interpretation of a functional brain
      scans requires not only anatomical knowledge, but also technical understanding on
      correctly performing a scan, regardless of the scanning modality. Awareness of
      technical limitations allows the clinician to properly interpret a functional
      brain scan. With this foundation, four scenarios in which perfusion SPECT
      neuroimaging, together with other imaging modalities and testing, lead to a
      narrowing of the differential diagnoses and better treatment. Lastly,
      recommendations for the revision of current policies and practices are made.

TI  - Metastatic Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma to Umbilical Skin.
PG  - e24568
LID - 10.7759/cureus.24568 [doi]
AB  - Sister Mary Joseph nodule (SMJN) is a rare metastasis to umbilical skin
      originating from internal tumors including the stomach, ovary and large intestine
      and less commonly from pancreatic cancers. We report an uncommon case of
      metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma to umbilical skin. An 85-year-old female
      presented with a 1.8 cm protrusion of the right lateral umbilicus. The CT scan
      showed a 3.5 cm pancreatic lesion, peritoneal carcinomatosis and abdominal
      lymphadenopathy. Histology examination revealed atypical infiltrative glandular
      structures. Immunohistochemistry showed positive CK7, negative CDX2 and P53 with 
      mutated patterns. These were consistent with metastatic adenocarcinoma most
      consistent with pancreatobiliary or upper GI origin. CK7 expresses in the ductal 
      cells in pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma. While CDX2 is positive in
      intestinal-type adenocarcinoma, it is negative in pancreatic ductal
      adenocarcinoma. The diagnosis of adenocarcinoma is rendered based on the presence
      of a pancreatic lesion in CT scan, positive CK7 and negative CDX2 in umbilical
      nodule tumor cells in the current patient.

TI  - Output compensation of auditory brainstem responses in dolphins and sea lions.
PG  - 3070
LID - 10.1121/10.0010389 [doi]
AB  - Cochlear dispersion causes increasing delays between neural responses from
      high-frequency regions in the cochlear base and lower-frequency regions toward
      the apex. For broadband stimuli, this can lead to neural responses that are
      out-of-phase, decreasing the amplitude of farfield neural response measurements. 
      In the present study, cochlear traveling-wave speed and effects of dispersion on 
      farfield auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) were investigated by first deriving 
      narrowband ABRs in bottlenose dolphins and California sea lions using the
      high-pass subtractive masking technique. Derived-band ABRs were then temporally
      aligned and summed to obtain the "stacked ABR" as a means of compensating for the
      effects of cochlear dispersion. For derived-band responses between 8 and 32 kHz, 
      cochlear traveling-wave speeds were similar for sea lions and dolphins [
      approximately 2-8 octaves (oct)/ms for dolphins; approximately 3.5-11 oct/ms for 
      sea lions]; above 32 kHz, traveling-wave speed for dolphins increased up to
      approximately 30 oct/ms. Stacked ABRs were larger than unmasked, broadband ABRs
      in both species. The amplitude enhancement was smaller in dolphins than in sea
      lions, and enhancement in both species appears to be less than reported in
      humans. Results suggest that compensating for cochlear dispersion will provide
      greater benefit for ABR measurements in species with better low-frequency
      hearing.

AB  - Hearing loss affects more than 430 million people, worldwide, and is the third
      most common chronic physical condition in the United States and Europe (GBD
      Hearing Loss Collaborators, 2021; NIOSH, 2021; WHO, 2021). The loss of hearing
      significantly impacts motor and cognitive development, communication, education, 
      employment, and overall quality of life. The inner ear houses the sensory organs 
      for both hearing and balance and provides an accessible target for therapeutic
      delivery. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) use various mechanisms to manipulate 
      gene expression and can be tailor-made to treat disorders with defined genetic
      targets. In this review, we discuss the preclinical advancements within the field
      of the highly promising ASO-based therapies for hereditary hearing loss
      disorders. Particular focus is on ASO mechanisms of action, preclinical studies
      on ASO treatments of hearing loss, timing of therapeutic intervention, and
      delivery routes to the inner ear.

LID - 10.1167/tvst.11.6.2 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To characterize macular blood flow connectivity in vivo using
      high-resolution optical coherence tomography (HighRes OCT). Methods:
      Cross-sectional, observational study. Dense (6-microm interscan distance)
      perifoveal HighRes OCT raster scans were performed on healthy participants. To
      mitigate the limitations of projection-resolved OCT-angiography, flow and
      structural data were used to observe the vascular structures of the superficial
      vascular complex (SVC) and the deep vascular complex. Vascular segmentation and
      rendering were performed using Imaris 9.5 software. Inflow and outflow patterns
      were classified according to vascular diameter and branching order from
      superficial arteries and veins, respectively. Results: Eight eyes from eight
      participants were included in this analysis, from which 422 inflow and 459
      outflow connections were characterized. Arteries had direct arteriolar
      connections to the SVC (78%) and to the intermediate capillary plexus (ICP, 22%).
      Deep capillary plexus (DCP) inflow derived from small-diameter vessels succeeding
      ICP arterioles. The most prevalent outflow pathways coursed through superficial
      draining venules (74%). DCP draining venules ordinarily merged with ICP draining 
      venules and drained independently of superficial venules in 21% of cases. The
      morphology of DCP draining venules in structural HighRes OCT is distinct from
      other vessels crossing the inner nuclear layer and can be used to identify
      superficial veins. Conclusions: Vascular connectivity analysis supports a hybrid 
      circuitry of blood flow within the human parafoveal macula. Translational
      Relevance: Characterization of parafoveal macular blood flow connectivity in vivo
      using a precise segmentation of HighRes OCT is consistent with ground-truth
      microscopy studies and shows a hybrid circuitry.

TI  - Association between dietary niacin and retinal nerve fibre layer thickness in
      healthy eyes of different ages.
LID - 10.1111/ceo.14120 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: To investigate the relationship between dietary intake of niacin
      (water-soluble form of vitamin B3 ) and retinal nerve fibre layer (RNFL)
      thickness in healthy eyes. METHODS: This cross-sectional study examined the
      association between daily niacin intake and RNFL thickness in three large
      population-based cohorts with varied age differences. RNFL thickness was
      extracted from optical coherence tomography data; energy-adjusted niacin intake
      was estimated from food frequency questionnaires. Linear mixed-effects models
      were utilised to examine the association between RNFL thickness and
      energy-adjusted niacin intake. Three separate analyses were conducted, with
      niacin treated as a continuous, a categorical (quartiles) or a dichotomous
      (above/below Australian recommended daily intake) variable. RESULTS: In total,
      4937 subjects were included in the study [Raine Study Gen2, n = 1204, median age 
      20; Busselton Healthy Ageing Study (BHAS), n = 1791, median age 64; TwinsUK, n = 
      1942, median age 64). When analysed as a continuous variable, there was no
      association between RNFL thickness and niacin intake in any of the three cohorts 
      (95% CI beta: Raine Study Gen 2, -0.174 to 0.074; BHAS, -0.066 to 0.078; TwinsUK 
      -0.435 to 0.350). Similar findings were observed with quartiles of niacin intake 
      and for niacin intakes above or below Australian recommended daily intake levels 
      in all three cohorts. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary intake of niacin from a standard diet 
      does not appear to be associated with age-related RNFL thinning in healthy eyes. 
      Supraphysiological doses of niacin may be required for therapeutic effect in the 
      retina.

TI  - Mouse Mx1 Inhibits Herpes Simplex Virus Type 1 Genomic Replication and Late Gene 
      Expression In Vitro and Prevents Lesion Formation in the Mouse Zosteriform Model.

AB  - Myxovirus resistance (Mx) proteins are dynamin-like GTPases that are inducible by
      interferons (IFNs) following virus infections. Most studies investigating Mx
      proteins have focused on their activity against influenza A viruses (IAV),
      although emerging evidence suggests that some Mx proteins may exhibit broader
      antiviral activity. Herein, we demonstrate that in addition to IAV,
      overexpression of mouse Mx1 (mMx1), but not mMx2, resulted in potent inhibition
      of growth of the human alphaherpesviruses herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) and
      HSV-2, whereas neither inhibited the mouse betaherpesvirus murine cytomegalovirus
      (MCMV) in vitro. IFN induction of a functional endogenous mMx1 in primary mouse
      fibroblasts ex vivo was also associated with inhibition of HSV-1 growth. Using an
      in vitro overexpression approach, we demonstrate that mutations that result in
      redistribution of mMx1 from the nucleus to the cytoplasm or in loss of its
      combined GTP binding and GTPase activity also abrogated its ability to inhibit
      HSV-1 growth. Overexpressed mMx1 did not inhibit early HSV-1 gene expression but 
      was shown to inhibit both replication of the HSV-1 genome as well as subsequent
      late gene expression. In a mouse model of cutaneous HSV-1 infection, mice
      expressing a functional endogenous mMx1 showed significant reductions in the
      severity of skin lesions as well as reduced HSV-1 titers in both the skin and
      dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Together, these data demonstrate that mMx1 mediates
      potent antiviral activity against human alphaherpesviruses by blocking
      replication of the viral genome and subsequent steps in virus replication.
      Moreover, endogenous mMx1 potently inhibited pathogenesis in the zosteriform
      mouse model of HSV-1 infection. IMPORTANCE While a number of studies have
      demonstrated that human Mx proteins can inhibit particular herpesviruses in
      vitro, we are the first to report the antiviral activity of mouse Mx1 (mMx1)
      against alphaherpesviruses both in vitro and in vivo. We demonstrate that both
      overexpressed mMx1 and endogenous mMx1 potently restrict HSV-1 growth in vitro.
      mMx1-mediated inhibition of HSV-1 was not associated with inhibition of virus
      entry and/or import of the viral genome into the nucleus, but rather with
      inhibition of HSV-1 genomic replication as well as subsequent late gene
      expression. Therefore, inhibition of human alphaherpesviruses by mMx1 occurs by a
      mechanism that is distinct from that reported for human Mx proteins against
      herpesviruses. Importantly, we also provide evidence that expression of a
      functional endogenous mMx1 can limit HSV-1 pathogenesis in a mouse model of
      infection.

TI  - Panophthalmitis secondary to retained intraocular foreign body amidst a national 
      lockdown during the COVID-19 pandemic: A case series and review of literature.
PG  - 103692
LID - 10.1016/j.amsu.2022.103692 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: Intraocular foreign bodies (IOFBs) can be serious as they may
      result in vision-threatening ocular inflammations and even loss of the eye. Delay
      in presentation or treatment by more than 24 hours from the time of injury
      results in a poor prognosis. In penetrating wounds, microorganisms enter the eye 
      through penetrating objects. Both bacterial and fungal organisms are responsible 
      for causing panophthalmitis. At the ocular level, these microorganisms produce
      irreversible damage which includes keratitis, uveitis, hypopyon, vitreous
      abscesses, retinal necrosis, detachment, and, finally, panophthalmitis. Case
      scenarios: In this case series, we report three cases of IOFB presenting with
      panophthalmitis secondary to delay in seeking medical attention. In our cases,
      there was a delay in the presentation by more than 24 hours of trauma. All cases 
      had panophthalmitis at the time of presentation. In two cases, the causative
      organism was coagulase-negative staphylococci and in one case it was
      staphylococcus. Initially, we planned to manage them with intravitreous,
      intravenous and topical antibiotics till the inflammation subsides, then IOFB
      removal surgeries were planned. However, in two cases, the clinical presentation 
      worsens with scleral necrosis. Therefore, they had to undergo evisceration. In
      one case, the antibiotics therapy was enough without IOFB removal surgery to
      manage her symptoms. All cases recovered uneventfully after the interventions.
      Discussion/Conclusion: In developing nations, like Nepal, transportation barriers
      can affect a person's access to health care services. This can be clearly
      explained from this case series as limited transportation options in rural
      regions are a major factor for all patients' delayed presentation to the hospital
      during the time of national lockdown in the second wave of the COVID-19 pandemic.
      The concerned authority must pay attention to solving such social determinants of
      health.

      Effect of copolymer/drug interaction.

AB  - Multiple w/o/w emulsions (MEs) are promising systems for protecting fragile
      hydrophilic drugs and controlling their release. We explore the capacity of a
      single pH-sensitive copolymer, PDMS60-b-PDMAEMA50, and salts, to form and
      stabilize MEs loaded with sucrose or catechin by a one-step mechanical process or
      a microfluidic method. ME cytotoxicity was evaluated in various conditions of pH.
      Using the mechanical process, the most stable emulsions were obtained with
      Miglyol(R)812 N and isopropyl myristate in a final pH range of 8-12 and [0.3 M-1 
      M] NaCl concentrations. Conversely, with the microfluidic method, isopropyl
      myristate at pH 3 without salt was more efficient. Catechin strongly affected the
      formation of droplets by the mechanical process but did not modify the conditions
      of stability of MEs obtained by the microfluidic method. The antioxidant power of
      catechin was preserved in the inner droplets, even in emulsions prepared by the
      mechanical method at pH 8. An incomplete release of sucrose and catechin from the
      emulsions was observed and attributed to the interaction of molecules with the
      copolymer through hydrogen bonding. This study highlights some of the barriers to
      break to formulate multiple emulsions stabilized by a PDMS-b-PDMAEMA copolymer or
      other polymers which can form hydrogen bonds interaction with encapsulated drugs.

TI  - Prevalence of urinary incontinence in female CrossFit athletes: a systematic
      review with meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s00192-022-05244-z [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION AND HYPOTHESIS: Studies on the prevalence of urinary incontinence
      (UI) among CrossFit practitioners are on the rise. This systematic review with
      meta-analysis was aimed at determining the prevalence of UI among CrossFit
      practitioners. METHODS: A systematic review of the literature was performed by
      searching MEDLINE/PubMed, Scopus, and SPORTDiscus through January 2021. The
      search strategy included the keywords CrossFit, urine incontinence, exercise,
      high impact and pelvic floor dysfunction. The inclusion criterion was any study
      with a sample of CrossFit practitioners and results separated from the other
      fitness modalities analysed. The subjects were women with no restriction of age, 
      parity, experience or frequency of training. Quality assessment of the studies
      included was conducted using the Oxford Centre of Evidence-Based Medicine scale
      and the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale (NOS) adapted for cross-sectional studies.
      RESULTS: Thirteen studies (6 comparative and 7 non-comparative) were included for
      the systematic review, all using a cross-sectional design. The level of evidence 
      was 4, with their quality ranging from poor (n = 10) to fair (n = 3). A total of 
      4,823 women aged 18 to 71 were included, 91.0% participated in CrossFit, and
      1,637 presented UI, which indicates a prevalence of 44.5%. Also, 55.3% and 40.7% 
      presented mild or moderate UI respectively. Stress UI was the most common type
      reported (81.2%). CONCLUSIONS: The factors that increased the likelihood of UI
      were age, body mass index and parity. Exercises based on jumps were commonly
      associated with urine leakage. CrossFit practitioners presented higher UI than
      control groups.

AB  - The fact that wild felines are carriers of pernicious infectious viruses should
      be a major concern due to the potential cross-species transmission between the
      felines and human or domestic animals. However, studies on the virus in the
      captive wild felines, especially in tigers, are thin on the ground. In this
      study, we screened four infectious viruses, namely, feline parvovirus (FPV),
      feline coronavirus (FCoV), canine distemper virus (CDV), and influenza A virus
      (IAV), in the blood samples of 285 captive Siberian tigers (Panthera tigris
      altaica) and in the spleen samples of two deceased lions (Panthera leo), which
      were collected from 2019 to 2021 in three Siberian Tiger Parks from the northeast
      of China. Nucleic acids isolated from the blood samples collected from tigers and
      the spleen samples collected from two deceased lions were positive for FPV by
      PCR, and the positive rate was 4.6% (13/285) in tigers. Furthermore, the VP2 gene
      of FPV was amplified by nested PCR, and the sequences of the VP2 gene from these 
      six FPV positive strains shared 98.3-99.9% homology with the reference. The key
      amino acid sites of VP2 protein were consistent with that of FPV reference
      strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on the VP2 gene showed that in this study,
      FPV-positive strains were grouped within the FPV clade and closely related to the
      Asian strains clade. The results of this study showed that FPV circulated in the 
      captive Siberian tigers and lions in northeastern China and provided valuable
      information for the study of FPV epidemiology in wild felines. Therefore, we
      suggest that regular antibody monitoring and booster immunization for tigers
      should be performed.

TI  - CD47 Binding on Vascular Endothelial Cells Inhibits IL-17-Mediated Leukocyte
      Adhesion.

AB  - To address the conflicting role of thrombospondin (TSP)-1 reported in acute and
      chronic pathologies, this study investigated the role of TSP-1 in regulating
      leukocyte recruitment and regulation of VCAM-1 expression using mouse models of
      uveitis. The spontaneously increased VCAM-1 expression and leukocyte adhesion in 
      retinas of TSP-1-deficient mice suggested a TSP-1-mediated regulation of VCAM-1
      expression. In a chronic uveitis model, induced by immunizing wild-type mice with
      specific interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) peptide, topically
      applied TSP-1-derived CD47-binding peptide significantly reduced the clinical
      disease course and retinal leukocyte adhesion as compared to the control
      peptide-treated group. In contrast, in LPS-mediated acute uveitis, TSP-1
      deficiency significantly reduced the retinal leukocyte adhesion. The results of
      our in vitro study, using vascular endothelial cell (EC) cultures, demonstrate
      that unlike TNF-alpha, VCAM-1 expression induced by IL-17 is associated with a
      reduced expression of endogenous TSP-1. Such reduced endogenous TSP-1 expression 
      in IL-17-stimulated ECs helps limit the CD36-mediated increased VCAM-1
      expression, while favoring CD47-mediated inhibition of VCAM-1 expression and
      leukocyte adhesion. Thus, our study identifies TSP-1:CD47 interaction as a
      molecular pathway that modulates IL-17-mediated VCAM-1 expression, contributing
      to its anti-inflammatory effect in chronic inflammatory conditions.

TI  - Locally Secreted Semaphorin 4D Is Engaged in Both Pathogenic Bone Resorption and 
      Retarded Bone Regeneration in a Ligature-Induced Mouse Model of Periodontitis.
LID - 5630 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23105630 [doi]
AB  - It is well known that Semaphorin 4D (Sema4D) inhibits IGF-1-mediated osteogenesis
      by binding with PlexinB1 expressed on osteoblasts. However, its elevated level in
      the gingival crevice fluid of periodontitis patients and the broader scope of its
      activities in the context of potential upregulation of osteoclast-mediated
      periodontal bone-resorption suggest the need for further investigation of this
      multifaceted molecule. In short, the pathophysiological role of Sema4D in
      periodontitis requires further study. Accordingly, attachment of the ligature to 
      the maxillary molar of mice for 7 days induced alveolar bone-resorption
      accompanied by locally elevated, soluble Sema4D (sSema4D), TNF-alpha and RANKL.
      Removal of the ligature induced spontaneous bone regeneration during the
      following 14 days, which was significantly promoted by anti-Sema4D-mAb
      administration. Anti-Sema4D-mAb was also suppressed in vitro osteoclastogenesis
      and pit formation by RANKL-stimulated BMMCs. While anti-Sema4D-mAb downmodulated 
      the bone-resorption induced in mouse periodontitis, it neither affected local
      production of TNF-alpha and RANKL nor systemic skeletal bone remodeling.
      RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis and resorptive activity were also suppressed by 
      blocking of CD72, but not Plexin B2, suggesting that sSema4D released by
      osteoclasts promotes osteoclastogenesis via ligation to CD72 receptor. Overall,
      our data indicated that ssSema4D released by osteoclasts may play a dual function
      by decreasing bone formation, while upregulating bone-resorption.

TI  - A Mahalanobis Surrogate-Assisted Ant Lion Optimization and Its Application in 3D 
      Coverage of Wireless Sensor Networks.
LID - 586 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/e24050586 [doi]
AB  - Metaheuristic algorithms are widely employed in modern engineering applications
      because they do not need to have the ability to study the objective function's
      features. However, these algorithms may spend minutes to hours or even days to
      acquire one solution. This paper presents a novel efficient Mahalanobis sampling 
      surrogate model assisting Ant Lion optimization algorithm to address this
      problem. For expensive calculation problems, the optimization effect goes even
      further by using MSAALO. This model includes three surrogate models: the global
      model, Mahalanobis sampling surrogate model, and local surrogate model.
      Mahalanobis distance can also exclude the interference correlations of variables.
      In the Mahalanobis distance sampling model, the distance between each ant and the
      others could be calculated. Additionally, the algorithm sorts the average length 
      of all ants. Then, the algorithm selects some samples to train the model from
      these Mahalanobis distance samples. Seven benchmark functions with various
      characteristics are chosen to testify to the effectiveness of this algorithm. The
      validation results of seven benchmark functions demonstrate that the algorithm is
      more competitive than other algorithms. The simulation results based on different
      radii and nodes show that MSAALO improves the average coverage by 2.122% and
      1.718%, respectively.

TI  - Antibiotic prophylaxis for corneal abrasion.
PG  - CD014617
LID - 10.1002/14651858.CD014617.pub2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Corneal abrasion is a common disorder frequently faced by
      ophthalmologists, emergency physicians, and primary care physicians. Ocular
      antibiotics are one of the management options for corneal abrasion. A
      comprehensive summary and synthesis of the evidence on antibiotic prophylaxis in 
      traumatic corneal abrasion is thus far unavailable, therefore we conducted this
      review to evaluate the current evidence regarding this important issue.
      OBJECTIVES: To assess the safety and efficacy of topical antibiotic prophylaxis
      following corneal abrasion. Our objectives were 1) to investigate the incidence
      of infection with antibiotics versus placebo or alternative antibiotics in people
      with corneal abrasion; and 2) to investigate time to clinical cure, defined as
      complete healing (re-epithelialization) of the epithelium, with antibiotics
      versus placebo or alternative antibiotics in people with corneal abrasion. SEARCH
      METHODS: We searched the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL)
      (which contains the Cochrane Eyes and Vision Trials Register; 2021, Issue 4),
      Ovid MEDLINE, Embase.com, PubMed, the Latin American and Caribbean Health
      Sciences Literature database (LILACS), ClinicalTrials.gov, and the World Health
      Organization (WHO) International Clinical Trials Registry Platform (ICTRP). We
      did not use any date or language restrictions in the electronic search for
      trials. We last searched the electronic databases on 25 April 2021. SELECTION
      CRITERIA: We included randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing antibiotic
      with another antibiotic or placebo in children and adults with corneal abrasion
      due to any cause. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: We used standard Cochrane
      methodology and assessed the certainty of the body of evidence for the
      prespecified outcomes using the GRADE classification. MAIN RESULTS: Our search of
      the electronic databases yielded 8661 records. We screened 7690 titles and
      abstracts after removal of duplicates. We retrieved 32 full-text reports for
      further review. We included two studies that randomized a total of 527 eyes of
      527 participants in the review. One study was conducted in Denmark, and one was
      conducted in India. The two studies did not examine most of our prespecified
      primary and secondary outcomes. The first study was a parallel-group RCT
      comparing chloramphenicol ocular ointment with fusidic acid ocular gels
      (frequency was not clearly reported). This study enrolled 153 participants older 
      than 5 years of age with corneal abrasion in Denmark with a one-day follow-up
      duration. No participants had secondary infection in the fusidic acid group,
      whereas three (4.1%) participants in the chloramphenicol group had a slight
      reaction (risk ratio [RR] 0.15, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.01 to 2.79; 144
      participants; very low certainty evidence). Thirty-one (44.3%) participants in
      the fusidic acid arm and 34 (46.6%) participants in the chloramphenicol arm were 
      cured (defined as the area of abrasion zero and no infection) at day 1 (RR 0.94, 
      95% CI 0.65 to 1.34; 144 participants; very low certainty evidence). Without
      providing specific data, the study reported that the degree of pain was not
      affected by the interventions received. The most common adverse events reported
      were itching and discomfort of the eye, which occurred in approximately one-third
      of participants in each group (low certainty evidence). A second multicenter,
      two-arm RCT conducted in India enrolled 374 participants older than 5 years of
      age with corneal abrasion who presented within 48 hours after injury. This study 
      investigated the effect of a three-day course of either ocular ointment
      combinations of chloramphenicol-clotrimazole or chloramphenicol-placebo (all
      three times daily). At day 3, 169 (100%) participants in the
      chloramphenicol-clotrimazole arm and 203 (99%) out of 205 participants in the
      chloramphenicol-placebo arm were cured without any complication, defined as
      complete epithelialization of the cornea without evidence of infection (RR 1.01, 
      95% CI 0.99 to 1.03; 374 participants; very low certainty evidence). Four
      participants assigned to the chloramphenicol-placebo arm experienced mild adverse
      events: two participants (1%) had mild chemosis and irritation, and two (1%) had 
      small single sterile corneal infiltrates (low certainty evidence). AUTHORS'
      CONCLUSIONS: Given the low to very low certainty of the available evidence, any
      beneficial effects of antibiotic prophylaxis in preventing ocular infection or
      accelerating epithelial healing following a corneal abrasion remain unclear.
      Moreover, the current evidence is insufficient to support any antibiotic regimen 
      being superior to another. There is a need for a well-designed RCT assessing the 
      efficacy and safety of ocular antibiotics in the treatment of corneal abrasion
      with a particular focus on high-risk populations and formulation of
      interventions.

TI  - Increased Asymmetric Perfusion of the Cerebral Cortices and Thalamus Indicates
      Individuals at Risk for Bipolar Disorder: A Family Cohort Single Photon Emission 
      Computed Tomography Neuroimaging Study.
PG  - 829561
LID - 10.3389/fpsyt.2022.829561 [doi]
AB  - Bipolar disorder is a significant mental illness affecting over 4 million people 
      in North America and approximately 46 million worldwide. While the onset of
      bipolar disorder is typically in late adolescence and early adulthood, the
      correct diagnosis can be delayed for several years. This delay can result in
      inappropriate pharmaceutical interventions, loss of career or productivity,
      suicide, family hardship, and unnecessary expense. Moreover, prolonged untreated 
      or inappropriately treated bipolar disorder may cause damage to the brain. Early 
      diagnosis is a critical need to circumvent the damage, suffering, and expense
      caused by the current delay. Brain perfusion single photon emission computed
      tomography (SPECT) neuroimaging reveals visual correlates of brain function.
      Herein, a family cohort all with bipolar disorder is described and their symptoms
      correlated with findings on the individual SPECT brain scans. The family
      consisted of two parents and three children (one female). The scans were
      interpreted by a panel of experts. Then a post hoc region-of-interest (ROI)
      analysis was conducted on SPECT data normalized to the cerebellum maximum with
      comparison to similarly normalized data from a normative sample. These findings
      support two distinct patterns of SPECT perfusion scan changes that can be found
      in individuals with bipolar disorder. In addition, these findings indicate that
      SPECT scan findings may be predictive of individual risk for progressing to
      symptomatic bipolar disorder. While preliminary, the findings in this cohort
      support the need for larger, diverse cohort studies of bipolar and control
      subjects to assess the predictive value of these particular SPECT perfusion
      findings in bipolar disorder.

AB  - The aim of this study was to evaluate the frequency of neoplasms in captive wild 
      felids in Southern Italy zoos over a 13-year period (2008-2021) and to
      investigate macroscopic and histologic tumor findings in these animals. A total
      of 24 cases were necropsied, 9 males and 15 females, with age ranging from 6 to
      19 years, including 12 tigers (Panthera tigris), 7 leopards (Panthera pardus), 4 
      lions (Panthera leo), and 1 black jaguar (Panthera onca). Diagnosis of neoplasm
      was made in 14/24 cases (58.3%). Tumors diagnosed were two cholangiocarcinomas,
      two hemangiosarcomas of the liver, two uterine leiomyomas, a renal
      adenocarcinoma, an adrenal gland adenoma, a thyroid carcinoma, an oral squamous
      cell carcinoma, an osteoma, a meningioma, a mesothelioma, an esophageal
      leiomyosarcoma, a muscoloskeletal leiomyosarcoma and a thyroid adenoma. The
      malignant and benign tumors were 62.5 and 37.5%, respectively. Among malignant
      tumors, no metastasis was observed in 50% of cases; in 10% of cases metastasis
      involved only regional lymph nodes; and distant metastases were found in 40% of
      cases. Based on our findings, the liver was the most frequent primary tumor site 
      (25%). The high rates of malignant and widely metastatic neoplasms suggest the
      importance of active monitoring and management of neoplasia in these threatened
      and endangered species.

TI  - Combined Bacterial Meningitis and Infective Endocarditis: When Should We Search
      for the Other When Either One is Diagnosed?
PG  - 1521-1540
LID - 10.1007/s40121-022-00651-7 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: We aimed to describe patients with coexisting infective
      endocarditis (IE) and bacterial meningitis (BM). METHODS: We merged two large
      prospective cohorts, an IE cohort and a BM cohort, with only cases of definite IE
      and community-acquired meningitis. We compared patients who had IE and BM
      concurrently to patients with IE only and BM only. RESULTS: Among the 1030
      included patients, we identified 42 patients with IE-BM (4.1%). Baseline
      characteristics of patients with IE-BM were mostly similar to those of patients
      with IE, but meningitis was the predominant presentation at admission (39/42,
      92.3%). Causative pathogens were predominantly Streptococcus pneumoniae (18/42,
      42.9%) and Staphylococcus aureus (14/42, 33.3%). All pneumococcal IE were
      associated with BM (18/18). BM due to oral and group D streptococci,
      Streptococcus agalactiae, and S. aureus were frequently associated with IE
      (14/30, 46.7%). Three-month mortality was 28.6% in patients with IE-BM, 20.5% in 
      patients with IE, and 16.6% in patients with BM. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with
      pneumococcal IE or altered mental status during IE must be investigated for BM.
      Patients with S. aureus, oral and group D streptococcal or enterococcal BM, or
      unfavorable outcome in pneumococcal meningitis would benefit from an
      echocardiography. Patients with the dual infection have the worst prognosis.
      Their identification is mandatory to initiate appropriate treatment.

TI  - Choroidal Thickening During Young Adulthood and Baseline Choroidal Thickness
      Predicts Refractive Error Change.
PG  - 34
LID - 10.1167/iovs.63.5.34 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: The purpose of this study was to explore the age-related change in
      choroidal thickness (ChT) and test the hypothesis that baseline ChT is predictive
      of refractive error change in healthy young adults. Methods: Participants
      underwent spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) imaging and
      autorefraction at 20 (baseline) and 28 years old. The enhanced depth imaging mode
      on the SD-OCT was used to obtain images of the choroid. Scans were exported from 
      the SD-OCT and analyzed with a custom software that automatically measures the
      central ChT. The longitudinal change in subfoveal ChT and association between
      baseline subfoveal ChT and 8-year change in refractive error (spherical
      equivalent) were determined using linear mixed models. Results: In total, 395
      eyes of 198 participants (44% men; 18-22 years at baseline) were included. Over 8
      years, mean spherical equivalent decreased by 0.25 diopters (D) and axial length 
      increased by 0.09 mm. Subfoveal choroid thickened by 1.3 microm/year (95%
      confidence interval [CI] = 0.6-2.0), but this was reduced by 0.9 microm/year (95%
      CI = 1.6-0.2) for every 1 mm increase in axial length. For every 10 microm
      increase in baseline ChT, average annual change in spherical equivalent and axial
      length reduced by 0.006 D/year and 0.003 mm/year, respectively. Conclusions: In a
      community-based cohort of young adults, the choroid continued to change during
      early adulthood. Choroidal thickening was less in eyes that were longer at
      baseline, and the choroid thinned in eyes that showed myopia progression. The
      association between baseline ChT and longitudinal changes in spherical equivalent
      and axial length supports the hypothesis that ChT may be predictive of refractive
      error development and/or myopia progression.

PG  - 824-829
LID - 10.33314/jnhrc.v19i04.3963 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Elevated intraocular pressure in thyroid associated orbitopathy may
      lead to development of secondary glaucoma in them. This study evaluated IOP in
      primary gaze correlation with clinical activity score in them. METHODS: A
      cross-sectional study was conducted from November 2020 to October
      2021.Information on age, gender, thyroid function test, intraocular pressure,
      cup-disc ratio and clinical activity score were recorded. Purposive sampling was 
      done. Statistical analysis was done using Statistical Package for Social Sciences
      version 21. RESULTS: Total of 74 thyroid dysfunction patients was included in the
      study. There were14.86% patients with raised intraocular pressure. The mean
      intraocular pressure in hyperthyroidism was 15.4 +/- 1.92 mm Hg and 15.48 +/-
      2.11mm Hg on right and left eyes respectively and in hypothyroidism, it was 15.08
      +/- 2.7mmHg and 15.12 +/- 3.02 mmHg on right and left eyes respectively. The mean
      clinical activity score was 1.06 +/- 1.23 mmHg. The mean intraocular pressure in 
      eyes in active stage (n=9) was 16.3 +/- 3.4 mm Hg, which was not significantly
      different from the mean intraocular pressure of 15 +/- 2.4 mm Hg in inactive eyes
      (64), p= 0.1. Clinical activity score showed a significant correlation (p=0.03)
      with intraocular pressure in right eyes whereas it showed no significant
      correlation with intraocular pressure in left eyes (p=0.37). CONCLUSIONS: In this
      study elevated intraocular pressure occurred in about 1 in 7 thyroid associated
      orbitopathy. It also had positive correlation with clinically activity score in
      right eyes. Regular intraocular pressure measurement should be done in thyroid
      associated orbitopathy to prevent intraocular morbidity.

TI  - Feed Insects as a Reservoir of Granadaene-Producing Lactococci.
PG  - 848490
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.848490 [doi]
AB  - Insects are a component of the diet of different animal species and have been
      suggested as the major source of human dietary protein for the future. However,
      insects are also carriers of potentially pathogenic microbes that constitute a
      risk to food and feed safety. In this study, we reported the occurrence of a
      hemolytic orange pigmented producing phenotype of Lactococcus
      garvieae/petauri/formosensis in the fecal microbiota of golden lion tamarins
      (Leontopithecus rosalia) and feed larvae (Zophobas atratus). Feed insects were
      identified as a regular source of L. garvieae/petauri/formosensis based on a
      reanalysis of available 16S rRNA gene libraries. Pan-genome analysis suggested
      the existence of four clusters within the L. garvieae/petauri/formosensis group. 
      The presence of cyl cluster indicated that some strains of the L.
      garvieae/petauri/formosensis group produced a pigment similar to granadaene, an
      orange cytotoxic lipid produced by group B streptococci, including Streptococcus 
      agalactiae. Pigment production by L. garvieae/petauri/formosensis strains was
      dependent on the presence of the fermentable sugars, with no pigment being
      observed at pH <4.7. The addition of buffering compounds or arginine, which can
      be metabolized to ammonium, restored pigment formation. In addition, pigment
      formation might be related to the source of peptone. These data suggest that
      edible insects are a possible source of granadaene-producing lactococci, which
      can be considered a pathogenic risk with zoonotic potential.

TI  - Geographical distribution of SARS-CoV-2 amino acids mutations and the concomitant
      evolution of seven distinct clades in non-human hosts.
LID - 10.1111/zph.12971 [doi]
AB  - Since its first emergence in December 2019, the world has witnessed the eruption 
      of mutations in the SARS-CoV-2 genome that have led to increased viral
      transmissibility and pathogenicity due to sustained local viral transmission.
      Zooanthroponotic and zoonotic transmissions have further raised concerns as they 
      could result in the emergence of viral variants with a novel antigenicity and
      transmissibility that could jeopardize the vaccine efficacy. To understand the
      viral evolution during such transmissions, 1016 whole-genome sequences (deposited
      in GISAID as of March 7, 2022) (from 18 countries) corresponding to mink, cat,
      deer, dog, hyena, tiger, lion, gorilla, Syrian hamster, leopard cat, fishing cat,
      bear cat, coati, ferret, snow leopard and green monkey have been analysed here.
      Intriguingly, phyloproteome analysis indicate that Nsp2:R218C,
      Nsp2:D268-(deletion), Spike:D614G, Nsp12:P323L, Nsp2:A192V, ORF3a protein:Q57H, N
      protein:R203K and N protein:G204R/L, Spike:A222V, ORF10 protein:V30L and N
      protein:A220V are moderate or high recurring and clade decisive mutations,
      leading to 6 primary clades during the early stage of pandemic. Most
      interestingly, the human evolved delta variant having a combination of 26 (clade 
      decisive) mutations defines the seventh clade and transmits to non-human hosts
      across the globe without exhibiting any country-specific mutation(s).
      Nonetheless, Spike:D614G and Nsp12:P323L together with (i)N protein:R203K,N
      protein:G204R/L,Spike:V70-, Spike:H69-, Nsp12:T739I, and Nsp1:M85-,
      (ii)Nsp2:A192V, Nsp3:D178Y, (iii)Nsp2:T85I, N protein:P67S and ORF3a protein:Q57H
      and (iv)Spike:A222V, ORF10 protein:V30L, N protein:A220V and Spike:F486I are
      specific to Denmark, Netherlands, USA and Latvia respectively and, (v)Nsp2:D268- 
      and Nsp13:R292C that are devoid of Spike:D614G and Nsp12:P323L is specific to
      Netherlands. SARS-CoV-2 variants consisting of these mutations are also seen in
      the human SARS-CoV-2 sequences from the same country. Independent
      country-specific SARS-CoV-2 variant evolution further indicates distinct
      epidemiological dynamics during zooanthroponotic and zoonotic transmissions.
      Thus, the results presented here indicate the need for the surveillance of viral 
      evolution in non-human hosts also during the future pandemic.

AB  - Standardized monitoring of BCR::ABL1 mRNA levels is essential for the management 
      of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) patients. From 2016 to 2021 the European
      Treatment and Outcome Study for CML (EUTOS) explored the use of secondary,
      lyophilized cell-based BCR::ABL1 reference panels traceable to the World Health
      Organization primary reference material to standardize and validate local
      laboratory tests. Panels were used to assign and validate conversion factors
      (CFs) to the International Scale and assess the ability of laboratories to assess
      deep molecular response (DMR). The study also explored aspects of internal
      quality control. The percentage of EUTOS reference laboratories (n = 50) with CFs
      validated as optimal or satisfactory increased from 67.5% to 97.6% and 36.4% to
      91.7% for ABL1 and GUSB, respectively, during the study period and 98% of
      laboratories were able to detect MR(4.5) in most samples. Laboratories with
      unvalidated CFs had a higher coefficient of variation for BCR::ABL1(IS) and some 
      laboratories had a limit of blank greater than zero which could affect the
      accurate reporting of DMR. Our study indicates that secondary reference panels
      can be used effectively to obtain and validate CFs in a manner equivalent to
      sample exchange and can also be used to monitor additional aspects of quality
      assurance.

TI  - Preoperative stoma site marking for fecal diversions (ileostomy and colostomy):
      position statement of the Canadian Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons and
      Nurses Specialized in Wound, Ostomy and Continence Canada.
PG  - E359-E363
LID - 10.1503/cjs.022320 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Every year, about 13 000 Canadians undergo an ostomy procedure, which
      requires stoma site marking to create a well-constructed stoma and prevent
      stoma-related complications. The Canadian Society of Colon and Rectal Surgeons
      (CSCRS) and Nurses Specialized in Wound, Ostomy and Continence Canada (NSWOCC)
      created a position statement to provide evidence-based guidance and techniques
      for stoma site selection. METHODS: A task force was formed comprising 20 health
      care professionals (7 colorectal surgeons from the CSCRS and 13 nurses from
      NSWOCC) with representation from across Canada. A literature review was
      performed, with the following databases searched from January 2009 to April 2019:
      MEDLINE, Embase, Cochrane, PubMed, CINAHL and Google Scholar. After the abstracts
      were screened, 6 task force members created a draft version of the position
      statement from the articles retained after full-text review. The draft was
      submitted to the entire task force for comments, and the ensuing modifications
      were incorporated. Peer reviewers were then recruited from the CSCRS and NSWOCC; 
      a summary of their comments was reviewed by the task force, and modifications
      were incorporated to produce the final document. RESULTS: The literature search
      identified 272 papers, of which 58 were reviewed after duplicates were excluded. 
      After full-text review, 18 papers were included to guide the position statement. 
      From these papers, we created a series of 17 steps for stoma site marking. Four
      general principles were found to be important for stoma site marking: obtain
      informed consent, identify important patient factors and landmarks, assess the
      abdomen and mark the most appropriate location. A 1-page enabler document and
      video were created as teaching aids and to help with dissemination of the
      information. CONCLUSION: This position statement, associated enabler document and
      video provide evidence-based guidance for stoma site marking in both emergency
      and elective settings, and should be used by surgeons and nurses specialized in
      wound, ostomy and continence to identify optimal stoma sites preoperatively.

TI  - Intraoperative hemostatic agents in orbital surgery.
PG  - 1-4
LID - 10.1080/01676830.2022.2079676 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: While preoperative optimization and post-operative management of
      hemorrhagic complications are increasingly clear, intraoperative control of
      bleeding during orbital surgery has received less attention. Thanks to advances
      in other fields, new technologies may be employed during these interventions.
      This review was designed to discuss these modalities. METHODS: A literature
      search was performed to identify manuscripts that are related to the management
      of intraoperative bleeding. The bibliographies of these studies were also
      assessed to identify additional references. Data was abstracted from these
      studies. RESULTS: Multiple hemostatic agents are currently used in orbital
      surgery, and related surgical fields have carefully assessed these interventions.
      Direct mechanical, flowable, and pro-thrombotic medications may all play key
      roles in achieving hemostasis. CONCLUSIONS: Orbital surgeons have several
      potential technologies to facilitate hemostasis, and the armamentarium continues 
      to grow. Future investigations will yield more targeted medications that may be
      delivered in novel manners to enhance the intraoperative experience.

TI  - Anti-Aging Potential of a Rosa centifolia Stem Extract with Focus on
      Phytochemical Composition by Bioguided Fractionation.
PG  - e202200158
LID - 10.1002/cbdv.202200158 [doi]
AB  - Agricultural practices generate huge amounts of by-products, often simply
      discarded as waste that must be processed at some cost. The natural by-products
      revalorisation as raw material to produce high-added value ingredients for
      various industrial sectors may pave the way towards more sustainable industrial
      practices, via an optimised utilisation of natural resources. Integrating the
      circular economy precepts to production systems is considered to be a more and
      more promising management solution to significantly reduce the environmental
      impact of economic activities. This article discusses the valorisation of Rosa
      centifolia stem to produce a natural extract with cosmetic anti-aging potential. 
      To do so, the cosmetic potential of 30 extracts obtained by maceration of
      agricultural by-products in a hydroalcoholic solvent was evaluated: their
      activities, as well as their inhibitory activities of specific enzymes were
      assessed in vitro to identify those that could be used effectively as anti-ageing
      actives while meeting the consumer's expectations in terms of sustainability,
      naturality, transparency and traceability.([1]) A hydroalcoholic extract of R.
      centifolia stem revealed itself particularly promising due to its valuable
      anti-hyaluronidase and antioxidant activities, and its interesting anti-elastase 
      and anti-inflammatory potential. The bio-guided fractionation of this extract
      allows the characterisation of three major compounds, e. g., isoquercitrin,
      quercitrin and euscaphic acid, never identified in R. centifolia previously.

TI  - Habitat use of and threats to African large carnivores in a mixed-use landscape.
LID - 10.1111/cobi.13943 [doi]
AB  - Large carnivores increasingly inhabit human-impacted landscapes, which exhibit
      heterogeneity in biotic resources, anthropogenic pressures, and management
      strategies. Understanding large carnivore habitat use in these modern systems is 
      critical for their conservation, as is the evaluation of competing management
      approaches and the impacts of significant land use changes. We employed occupancy
      modelling to investigate habitat use of an intact eastern African large carnivore
      guild across the 45,000 km2 Ruaha-Rungwa landscape, in south-central Tanzania. We
      determined the relative impact of biotic, anthropogenic, and management factors
      on five large carnivore species, at two biologically meaningful scales. We also
      specifically tested the effect of a novel trend of trophy hunting area
      abandonment on large carnivore occurrence. Our results reveal contrasting habitat
      use patterns: lion were found to be particularly vulnerable to illegal human
      activity, while African wild dog were instead limited by biotic features,
      avoiding areas of high sympatric predator density and using less-productive
      habitats. Spotted hyaena and leopard were able to persist in more disturbed
      areas, and across habitat types. There was no evidence of large carnivore
      occurrence being impacted by whether an area was used for photographic or trophy 
      hunting tourism, with regular law enforcement being instead more important. All
      species fared better in actively managed hunting areas compared to those that had
      been abandoned by operators. Overall, our findings highlight the divergent
      habitat requirements within large carnivore guilds, and the importance of
      adopting an integrated approach to large carnivore conservation planning in
      modern systems. We also identified a novel threat to African conservation areas, 
      in the form of decreased management investments associated with the abandonment
      of trophy hunting areas, and provide the first assessment of this significant
      land management change on a large carnivore population. Article impact statement:
      Habitat degradation associated with ongoing hunting area abandonment is shown to 
      be a novel threat to large African carnivore populations. This article is

AB  - In 1997, Donald A.B. Lindberg M.D., Director, U.S. National Library of Medicine
      (NLM) agreed to address the request of African malaria researchers for full
      access to the Internet and medical journals as part of the U.S. National
      Institutes of Health's (NIH) contribution to the Multilateral Initiative on
      Malaria (MIM). This challenge matched my interests and previous experience in
      Africa. I joined NLM in 1997 to help establish the MIM Communications Network
      (MIMCom) in partnership with several NIH components and more than 30 other
      partners in Africa, the U.S., the United Kingdom (U.K.), and Europe. After a
      successful launch of MIMCom, NLM worked with African partners to create a series 
      of innovative programs with scientists, librarians, journal editors, and medical 
      students to build capacity on the continent and enhance global access to research
      in Africa.

TI  - Identification of a Novel Astrovirus in Pinnipeds.
PG  - 845601
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.845601 [doi]
AB  - Astroviruses infect human and animals and cause diarrhea, fever, and vomiting. In
      severe cases, these infections may be fatal in infants and juvenile animals.
      Previous evidence showed that humans in contact with infected animals can develop
      serological responses to astroviruses. Mamastrovirus 11 is a species of
      Mamastrovirus and was first reported in 2018. It was detected in the fecal
      samples of a California sea lion. The genome sequence of its capsid protein (CP) 
      was submitted to GenBank. However, the genome sequence of its non-structural
      protein region was not elucidated. In the present study, we characterized the
      genome sequences of the novel astroviruses AstroV-HMU-1 and AstroV-like-HMU-2.
      These were obtained from California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) and
      walruses (Odobenus rosmarus) presenting with loose stools. A phylogenetic
      analysis revealed that the CP of AstroV-HMU-1 closely clustered with
      Mamastrovirus 11 while its RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and serine
      protease (SP) were closely related to the mink astrovirus in the genus
      Mamastrovirus. The genome of AstroV-HMU-1 provided basic information regarding
      the NS protein regions of Mamastrovirus 11. Recombination analyses showed that
      the genomes of Z. californianus AstroV-HMU-1, VA2/human and the mink astrovirus
      may have recombined long ago. The NS of AstroV-like-HMU-2 segregated from the
      Astroviridae in the deep root of the phylogenetic tree and exhibited 36% amino
      acid identity with other mamastroviruses. Thus, AstroV-like-HMU-2 was proposed as
      a member of a new genus in the unclassified Astroviridae. The present study
      suggested that that the loose stools of pinnipeds may be the result of occasional
      infection by this novel astrovirus. This discovery provides a scientific basis
      for future investigations into other animal-borne infectious diseases.

AB  - Inadvertent neodymium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) capsulotomies are rare,
      with only one incident reported in the literature prior to the present case. We
      discuss the management of a phakic patient with a dense posterior subcapsular
      cataract who underwent yttrium-aluminum-garnet (YAG) capsulotomy for presumed
      posterior capsular opacification. Operative course involved cataract surgery with
      anterior vitrectomy for prolapsed lens fragments due to the disrupted posterior
      capsule. This patient experienced excellent visual outcomes postoperatively, with
      ultimate best-corrected visual acuity of 20/20. This case underscores the
      importance of thorough preoperative time out, including confirmation of patient's
      understanding of the intended procedure.

AB  - Worldwide, glaucoma affects about 3% of the population over the age of 50 years
      and is a leading cause of irreversible visual impairment among older people.
      Because glaucoma is asymptomatic in its early stages and can be challenging to
      diagnose clinically, it often remains undiagnosed until substantial vision loss
      has occurred. Efficient methods of glaucoma screening are therefore warranted for
      early detection of disease. Identification of risk factors for glaucoma - family 
      history of glaucoma, older age, African or Asian ethnicities, raised intraocular 
      pressure, and thin corneas - have helped inform guidelines on the recommended age
      at commencement and frequency of glaucoma screenings. A genetic predisposition or
      family history of glaucoma is one of the most important risk factors for the
      disease. However, an accurate family history cannot always be ascertained.
      Genetic testing for genes such as myocilin could help to identify high-risk
      individuals and, with further research, could even provide insight into
      individual patients' response to treatment. With the ongoing discovery of
      glaucoma-associated genes and the advent of polygenic risk scores to identify
      individuals at high risk of glaucoma, gene-based screening for glaucoma is
      becoming closer to realisation. In the meantime, regularly screening family
      members of people with existing glaucoma is an efficient way of detecting early
      glaucoma. Raising public awareness of glaucoma is also necessary to educate the
      general public on the key role of routine eye examinations and early disease
      detection. Future studies should be undertaken to explore efficient public health
      campaign methods for improving glaucoma awareness.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the repeatability and reproducibility of corneal
      measurements performed by the Galilei G6 and determine its agreement with the
      Pentacam(R) AXL. METHODS: 105 eyes underwent examination by both devices,
      measuring nine parameters. Paired t-tests, Deming Regression, and Bland-Altman
      plots were used to determine agreement. Analysis of Variance was used to
      determine repeatability and reproducibility. RESULTS: Measurements showed no
      clinically significant differences between the two devices. On average, the
      Galilei G6 measured axial length longer than the Pentacam(R) AXL by 0.05 mm +/-
      0.03 mm (p < 0.001), just 0.2% of the mean value and therefore clinically
      insignificant. It measured central corneal thickness and anterior chamber depth
      3.77 mum +/- 7.71 mum longer (p < 0.001) and 0.04 mm +/- 0.07 mum shorter (p <
      0.001), respectively. They are also clinically insignificant, constituting just
      0.7% and 1% of the mean values. The results showed evidence of repeatability and 
      reproducibility. Only measurements of corneal cylinder showed some clinically
      significant variance. CONCLUSIONS: The Galilei G6 and Pentacam(R) AXL
      measurements show evidence of repeatability, reproducibility, and agreement for
      examined parameters. Certain caution needs to be applied in cases with moderate
      or severe corneal cylinder, due to discrepancies in repeatability and
      reproducibility of corneal cylinder measurements with the Galilei G6.

TI  - Enhanced short-wavelength sensitivity in the blue-tongued skink Tiliqua rugosa.
LID - jeb244317 [pii]
LID - 10.1242/jeb.244317 [doi]
AB  - Despite lizards using a wide range of colour signals, the limited variation in
      photoreceptor spectral sensitivities across lizards suggests only weak selection 
      for species-specific, spectral tuning of photoreceptors. Some species, however,
      have enhanced short-wavelength sensitivity, which probably helps with the
      detection of signals rich in ultraviolet and short wavelengths. In this study, we
      examined the visual system of Tiliqua rugosa, which has an ultraviolet/blue
      tongue, to gain insight into this species' visual ecology. We used
      electroretinograms, opsin sequencing and immunohistochemical labelling to
      characterize whole-eye spectral sensitivity and the elements that shape it. Our
      findings reveal that T. rugosa expresses all five opsins typically found in
      lizards (SWS1, SWS2, RH1, RH2 and LWS) but possesses greatly enhanced
      short-wavelength sensitivity compared with other diurnal lizards. This enhanced
      short-wavelength sensitivity is characterized by a broadening of the spectral
      sensitivity curve of the eye towards shorter wavelengths while the peak
      sensitivity of the eye at longer wavelengths (560 nm) remains similar to that of 
      other diurnal lizards. While an increased abundance of SWS1 photoreceptors is
      thought to mediate elevated ultraviolet sensitivity in a couple of other lizard
      species, SWS1 photoreceptor abundance remains low in this species. Instead, our
      findings suggest that short-wavelength sensitivity is driven by multiple factors 
      which include a potentially red-shifted SWS1 photoreceptor and the absence of
      short-wavelength-absorbing oil droplets. Examining the coincidence of enhanced
      short-wavelength sensitivity with blue tongues among lizards of this genus will
      provide further insight into the co-evolution of conspecific signals and
      whole-eye spectral sensitivity.

AB  - Ordinary biochar has the disadvantages of low strength and fragility, and it is
      difficult to be separated in heavy metal contaminated soil after the remediation 
      process. In order to realize the recovery and reuse of biochar, we prepared
      silicate composite biochar (SCB) and the magnetic silicate composite biochar
      (MSCB) with consistent particle size and high hardness. As well as the
      passivation effect and mechanism of the material on cadmium in soil was also
      investigated. The results showed that: (1) The MSCB had good hydraulic properties
      and strong magnetism, which can be quickly separated from the soil under the
      condition of external magnetic field. (2) The MSCB can remove 30.32%-38.80% of
      cadmium in the soil after three times of
      "application-separation-desorption-reuse", as well as the SCB can remove
      28.30%-35.78% of cadmium from the soil. (3) The recovered SCB and MSCB had a
      certain mass loss, the mass loss rate of the biochar particles was in the range
      of 2.65%-4.90% after each time of recycling. (4) MSCB mainly immobilized cadmium 
      ions through pore interception, complexation of oxygen-containin/iron-containin
      functional group and precipitation reaction.

AB  - Urbanization of coastal habitats, of which harbors and marinas are the paragon,
      has led to various ecological paradigms about their functioning. Harbor
      infrastructures offer new hard substrata that are colonized by a wide variety of 
      organisms (biofouling) including many introduced species. These structures also
      modify hydrodynamism and contaminant dispersal, leading to strong disturbance
      gradients within them. Differences in sessile community structure have previously
      been correlated to these gradients at small spatial scale (<100 m). Local
      adaptation might be involved to explain such results, but as correlation is not
      causation, the present study aims to understand the causal link between the
      environmental gradients and community structure through a reciprocal transplant
      experiment among three sites of a marina (inner, middle, entrance). Our results
      highlighted strong small-scale spatial variations of contaminants (trace metals, 
      PCB, pesticides, and PAH) in sediments and animal samples which have been
      causally linked to changes in community composition after transplant. But
      historical contingency and colonization succession also play an important role.
      Our results provided strong evidence for local adaptation since community
      structure, respiration, and pollutant uptake in Bugula neritina, as well as the
      metabolomes of B. neritina and Ciona intestinalis were impacted by the transplant
      with a disadvantage for individuals transplanted from the entrance to the inner
      location. The here observed results may thus indicate that the disturbance
      gradient in marinas might constitute a staple for selecting pollutant-resistant
      species and populations, causing local adaptation. This highlights the importance
      of conducting further studies into small scale local adaptation.

TI  - Right laparoscopic pudendal release + neurostimulator prosthesis (LION procedure)
      in pudendal neuralgia.
LID - 10.1111/codi.16190 [doi]
AB  - AIM: Pudendal neuralgia is a highly disabling entity with complex diagnostic and 
      controversial treatment results. Surgical neurolysis has been shown to be the
      most effective treatment. Sacral root neurostimulation or posterior tibial nerve 
      stimulation are used to rescue patients who either have not responded to surgery 
      or have worsened after an initial improvement. METHODS: Given the excellent
      visualization of the pudendal nerve during laparoscopic pudendal release, we
      propose to combine this procedure with neurostimulation, taking advantage of the 
      possibility of in situ placement of the electrode. The abdominal cavity is
      accessed laparoscopically through four ports, and after identifying and releasing
      the pudendal nerve a neurostimulation electrode is placed next to the nerve and
      is connected to a generator located in a subcutaneous pocket. RESULTS: This
      procedure has been performed in one patient with a satisfactory result.
      CONCLUSIONS: Laparoscopic pudendal release with neurostimulator prosthesis is an 
      experimental technique that can be promising for the treatment of pudendal
      neuralgia.

TI  - ST-AL: a hybridized search based metaheuristic computational algorithm towards
      optimization of high dimensional industrial datasets.
PG  - 1-29
LID - 10.1007/s00500-022-07115-7 [doi]
AB  - The rapid growth of data generated by several applications like engineering,
      biotechnology, energy, and others has become a crucial challenge in the high
      dimensional data mining. The large amounts of data, especially those with high
      dimensions, may contain many irrelevant, redundant, or noisy features, which may 
      negatively affect the accuracy and efficiency of the industrial data mining
      process. Recently, several meta-heuristic optimization algorithms have been
      utilized to evolve feature selection techniques for dealing with the vast
      dimensionality problem. Despite optimization algorithms' ability to find the
      near-optimal feature subset of the search space, they still face some global
      optimization challenges. This paper proposes an improved version of the sooty
      tern optimization (ST) algorithm, namely the ST-AL method, to improve the search 
      performance for high-dimensional industrial optimization problems. ST-AL method
      is developed by boosting the performance of STOA by applying four strategies. The
      first strategy is the use of a control randomization parameters that ensure the
      balance between the exploration-exploitation stages during the search process;
      moreover, it avoids falling into local optimums. The second strategy entails the 
      creation of a new exploration phase based on the Ant lion (AL) algorithm. The
      third strategy is improving the STOA exploitation phase by modifying the main
      equation of position updating. Finally, the greedy selection is used to ignore
      the poor generated population and keeps it from diverging from the existing
      promising regions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed ST-AL algorithm,
      it has been employed as a global optimization method to discover the optimal
      value of ten CEC2020 benchmark functions. Also, it has been applied as a feature 
      selection approach on 16 benchmark datasets in the UCI repository and compared
      with seven well-known optimization feature selection methods. The experimental
      results reveal the superiority of the proposed algorithm in avoiding local minima
      and increasing the convergence rate. The experimental result are compared with
      state-of-the-art algorithms, i.e., ALO, STOA, PSO, GWO, HHO, MFO, and MPA and
      found that the mean accuracy achieved is in range 0.94-1.00.

TI  - Molecular Identification and Phylogenetic Analysis of Ascarids in Wild Animals.
PG  - 891672
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.891672 [doi]
AB  - Ascarid nematodes are the most common and harmful nematodes parasites in animals.
      By analyzing genetic variation, this study explores the genetic and phylogenetic 
      relationship among ascarids from 11 different hosts. This study collected ascarid
      samples from the feces of nine animal species in Changsha Ecological Zoo of Hunan
      Province and two animal kinds in the College of Veterinary Medicine of Hunan
      Agricultural University. The mitochondrial gene (pcox1) and ribosomal ITS
      sequences were amplified, sequenced, and analyzed by PCR to identify the species 
      of the samples. The phylogenetic tree was constructed based on two genes (cox1
      and ITS) by the Neighbor-joining method, and the phylogenetic relationship was
      analyzed. The sequencing results showed that the sequence lengths of pcox1 and
      ITS genes in the samples were 441 bp and 838-1,177 bp, respectively. The
      difference rates were 0.00-1.70% in pcox1 gene and 0.00-7.30% in ITS gene.
      Phylogenetic analysis showed that ascarid worms from the white lion, Northeast
      tiger, South China tiger and cheetah were identified as Toxascaris leonina.
      Ascarids from the zebra were identified as Parascaris equorum, while those from
      chicken and peacocks were identified as Ascaridia galli. Ascarids of wolf and dog
      origin were Toxocara canis, the snake ascarids belonged to Ophidascaris filaria, 
      and the bear ascarids belonged to Baylisascaris transfuga. There was a
      significant gap between different kinds of ascarid worms. We found that these two
      mitochondrial genes pcox1 and ITS showed a common characteristic that the
      intraspecific differences were significantly smaller than the interspecific
      differences, confirming that these two genes could be used as interspecific
      genetic markers for molecular identification of different ascarids origins. The
      intraspecific variation rate of the ITS gene was higher than that of pcox1,
      indicating that ITS can also be used in the genetic research of Ascaris species
      development. This study revealed the genetic evolution and phylogeny of ascarids 
      in wild animals, and our results will help prevent and control ascarids in wild
      animals.

TI  - Prevalence and Risk Factors of Myopia in Young Adults: Review of Findings From
      the Raine Study.
PG  - 861044
LID - 10.3389/fpubh.2022.861044 [doi]
AB  - Myopia tends to develop and progress fastest during childhood, and the age of
      stabilization has been reported to be 15-16 years old. Thus, most studies on
      myopia have centered on children. Data on the refractive error profile in young
      adulthood - a time in life when myopia is thought to have stabilized and
      refractive error is unaffected by age-related pathology such as cataract - are
      limited. The Raine Study has been following a community-based cohort of young
      adults representative of the general Western Australia population since their
      prenatal periods in 1989-1991, with eye examinations performed when participants 
      were 20 and 28 years old. At 20 years old, prevalence of myopia in the cohort was
      25.8%. Using long-term trajectory of serum vitamin D levels and conjunctival
      ultraviolet autofluorescence (CUVAF) area to objectively quantify sun exposure,
      the Raine Study confirmed a negative relationship between time spent outdoors and
      myopia prevalence. However, prospective studies are required to determine the
      amount of CUVAF area or serum vitamin D levels associated with time duration.
      Combining data from the Raine Study and several other cohorts, Mendelian
      randomization studies have confirmed a link between myopia and a genetic
      predisposition toward higher education. Several novel potential associations of
      myopia or ocular biometry were investigated, including fetal growth trajectory,
      which was found to be significantly associated with corneal curvature at 20
      years. By age 28, myopia prevalence had increased to 33.2%. Between 20 and 28
      years old, myopia progressed and axial length elongated, on average, by
      -0.041D/year and 0.02 mm/year, respectively. Smaller CUVAF area at follow-up,
      female sex, and parental myopia were significant risk factors for myopia
      incidence and progression between 20 and 28 years. Given the limited research in 
      young adults, further investigations are warranted to confirm the Raine Study
      findings, as well as identify novel genetic or environmental factors of myopia
      incidence and progression in this age group.

TI  - Prevalence of Toxoplasmic Retinochoroiditis in an Australian Adult Population: A 
      Community-Based Study.
LID - S2468-6530(22)00215-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.oret.2022.04.022 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis is the most common clinical manifestation 
      of an infection with the protozoan parasite, Toxoplasma gondii. Up to 50% of the 
      human population is estimated to be infected with T. gondii; however, the
      epidemiology of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis has not been widely reported. We
      sought to estimate the prevalence of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis in Australia
      using data that were collected as part of the Busselton Healthy Ageing Study.
      DESIGN: Cross-sectional, community-based, prospective cohort study. PARTICIPANTS:
      5020 Australian adults (2264 men and 2756 women; age range, 45-69 years, and
      median age, 58 years). METHODS: Retinal color photographs, centered on the optic 
      disc and macula, were captured using a digital retinal camera after the dilation 
      of the pupils. Three uveitis-subspecialized ophthalmologists assessed each
      pigmented retinal lesion, and complete concordance of opinion was required to
      assign a toxoplasmic etiology. Serum T. gondii immunoglobulin (Ig)G levels were
      measured for those participants with retinal lesions judged to be toxoplasmic
      retinochoroiditis. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Prevalence of toxoplasmic
      retinochoroiditis. RESULTS: Eight participants (0.16%) had retinal lesions that
      were considered to have the characteristic appearance of toxoplasmic
      retinochoroiditis, plus detectable serum T. gondii IgG, consistent with the
      diagnosis of toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis. On the assumption that 23.81% of
      retinal lesions occur at the posterior pole, as reported in a community-based
      survey conducted in Brazil (Sci Rep. 2021;11:3420), the prevalence of toxoplasmic
      retinochoroiditis was estimated to be 0.67% or 1 per 149 persons. CONCLUSIONS:
      Toxoplasmic retinochoroiditis is common in Australian adults. Efforts to quantify
      and address risk factors for human infection with T. gondii are justified.

TI  - Impact of thymidine phosphorylase and CD163 expression on prognosis in stage II
      colorectal cancer.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tumor-associated macrophages (TAM) are known to facilitate colorectal
      cancer (CRC) growth. High macrophage infiltration in thymidine phosphorylase
      (TYMP) expressing CRC may correspond to poor prognosis. The prognostic impact of 
      the expression CD163, a receptor associated with TAM, and TYMP in stroma,
      respectively, tumor tissue is not yet established. The aim of this study was to
      identify the potential associations between TYMP and CD163 expression levels and 
      relapse-free survival (RFS) of patients with stage II CRC, and if microdissection
      is of importance. METHODS: Stage II CRC patients, radically resected with relapse
      (n = 104), were matched to patients with a 5-year relapse-free follow-up (n =
      206). Gene expression of TYMP and CD163 was analyzed in snap-frozen tumor tissues
      and in microdissected formalin-fixed tumor tissues separated into tumor
      epithelium and stroma. RESULTS: TYMP expression was high in poorly differentiated
      tumors, right-sided CRC, and tumors with high microsatellite instability
      CD163-expressing macrophages near tumor epithelial cells had high expression in
      poorly differentiated and T4 tumors. High TYMP expression in tumor epithelial
      cells was in the multivariate analyses associated with shorter relapse-free
      survival (hazard ratio 1.66; 95% confidence interval: 1.09-2.56; p < 0.05).
      CONCLUSIONS: TYMP expression in tumor epithelial cells was associated with RFS
      and emphasizes the need for tissue microdissection. Additional studies are needed
      to establish whether TYMP and CD163 could add clinically relevant information to 
      identify high-risk stage II patients that could benefit from adjuvant
      chemotherapy.

TI  - Prognostic Significance of GPR55 mRNA Expression in Colon Cancer.
LID - 4556 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23094556 [doi]
AB  - G protein-coupled receptor 55 (GPR55) probably plays a role in innate immunity
      and tumor immunosurveillance through its effect on immune cells, such as T cells 
      and NK cells. In this study, the prognostic value of GPR55 in colon cancer (CC)
      was investigated. mRNA expression levels of GPR55 were determined in 382 regional
      lymph nodes of 121 CC patients with 12 years observation time after curative
      surgery. The same clinical material had previously been analyzed for expression
      levels of CEA, CXCL16, CXCL17, GPR35 V2/3 and LGR5 mRNAs. Clinical cutoffs of
      0.1365 copies/18S rRNA unit for GPR55 and 0.1481 for the GPR55/CEA ratio were
      applied to differentiate between the high- and low-GPR55 expression groups.
      Kaplan-Meier survival analysis and Cox regression risk analysis were used to
      determine prognostic value. Improved discrimination between the two groups was
      achieved by combining GPR55 with CEA, CXCL16 or CXCL17 compared with GPR55 alone.
      The best result was obtained using the GPR55/CEA ratio, with an increased mean
      survival time of 14 and 33 months at 5 and 12 years observation time,
      respectively (p = 0.0003 and p = 0.003) for the high-GPR55/CEA group. The
      explanation for the observed improvement is most likely that GPR55 is a marker
      for T cells and B cells in lymph nodes, whereas CEA, CXCL16 and CXCL17, are
      markers for tumor cells of epithelial origin.

TI  - Endothelial Cells Activated by Extracellular Histones Promote Foxp3(+)
      Suppressive Treg Cells In Vitro.
LID - 4527 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23094527 [doi]
AB  - Histones are widely recognized as pro-inflammatory mediators upon their release
      from the nucleus into the extracellular space. However, their impact on
      endothelial cell immunogenicity is unknown. Endothelial cells, Human
      Microvascular Endothelial cells 1 (HMEC1), have been exposed to recombinant
      histones in order to study their effect on the endothelial phenotype. We then
      studied the differentiation of CD4(+)-T lymphocytes subpopulations after three
      days of interaction with endothelial cells in vitro and observed that
      histone-treated endothelial cells differentiate a suppressive FoxP3(+) T
      regulator subpopulation that expressed Human Leucocyte Antigen DR (HLA-DR) and
      Cytotoxic T-Lymphocyte-Associated protein 4 (CTLA4). Toll-Like Receptor 4 (TLR4) 
      inhibition significantly decreased the expansion of these Treg cells. Moreover,
      blockade of Interleukin (IL)-6 and Intercellular Adhesion Molecule (ICAM)-1 in
      cocultures significantly decreased the expansion of Tregs, suggesting an IL-6 and
      ICAM-1 dependent pathway. Thus, beyond their inflammatory effects, extracellular 
      histones may induce an increase of immunosuppressive Treg population via their
      action on endothelial cells. Further studies are needed to evaluate the impact on
      immunosuppression of an increase of peripheral suppressive Treg via endothelial
      cell activation by histones in vivo.

TI  - An efficient ANFIS-EEBAT approach to estimate effort of Scrum projects.
PG  - 7974
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-11565-2 [doi]
AB  - Software effort estimation is a significant part of software development and
      project management. The accuracy of effort estimation and scheduling results
      determines whether a project succeeds or fails. Many studies have focused on
      improving the accuracy of predicted results, yet accurate estimation of effort
      has proven to be a challenging task for researchers and practitioners,
      particularly when it comes to projects that use agile approaches. This work
      investigates the application of the adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system (ANFIS)
      along with the novel Energy-Efficient BAT (EEBAT) technique for effort prediction
      in the Scrum environment. The proposed ANFIS-EEBAT approach is evaluated using
      real agile datasets. It provides the best results in all the evaluation criteria 
      used. The proposed approach is also statistically validated using nonparametric
      tests, and it is found that ANFIS-EEBAT worked best as compared to various
      state-of-the-art meta-heuristic and machine learning (ML) algorithms such as
      fireworks, ant lion optimizer (ALO), bat, particle swarm optimization (PSO), and 
      genetic algorithm (GA).

      a Case.
PG  - e80-e82
LID - 10.1097/IOP.0000000000002116 [doi]
AB  - Squamoid eccrine ductal carcinoma (SEDC) is a rare cutaneous neoplasm that often 
      manifests as a plaque or nodule in sun-exposed areas of older patients. Herein,
      the authors report the first case of SEDC in the eyelid. A 76-year-old man
      presented with a 2.5 x 1.5 mm area of left upper eyelid erythema, thickening,
      ulceration, and scaling with madarosis superotemporally just above the lash line.
      Full-thickness wedge biopsy demonstrated irregular epithelial tubules with
      nuclear atypia and focal squamous differentiation, consistent with SEDC. The
      patient underwent Mohs resection and has had no recurrence approximately 27
      months after surgical removal. The authors present this case to raise awareness
      of SEDC to ophthalmologists as all previous cases have been described in the
      nonophthalmic literature. A full-thickness biopsy is recommended to avoid
      misdiagnosing SEDC as squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), a less aggressive tumor.
      With greater awareness, there may be increased recognition of this likely
      underreported, more malignant entity.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop EULAR points-to-consider for therapeutic drug monitoring
      (TDM) of biopharmaceuticals in inflammatory rheumatic and musculoskeletal
      diseases (RMDs). METHODS: The points-to-consider were developed in accordance
      with EULAR standardised operation procedures by a multidisciplinary task force
      from eight European countries, based on a systematic literature review and expert
      consensus. Level of evidence and strength of the points-to-consider were
      determined, and mean levels of agreement among the task force were calculated
      using a 10-point rating scale. RESULTS: Six overarching principles and 13
      points-to-consider were formulated. The level of agreement among the task force
      for the overarching principles and points-to-consider ranged from 8.4 to 9.9.The 
      overarching principles define TDM and its subtypes, and reinforce the underlying 
      pharmacokinetic/pharmacodynamic principles, which are relevant to all
      biopharmaceutical classes. The points-to-consider highlight the clinical utility 
      of the measurement and interpretation of biopharmaceutical blood concentrations
      and antidrug antibodies in specific clinical scenarios, including factors that
      influence these parameters. In general, proactive use of TDM is not recommended
      but reactive TDM could be considered in certain clinical situations. An important
      factor limiting wider adoption of TDM is the lack of both high quality trials
      addressing effectiveness and safety of TDM and robust economic evaluation in
      patients with RMDs. Future research should focus on providing this evidence, as
      well as on further understanding of pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic
      characteristics of biopharmaceuticals. CONCLUSION: These points-to-consider are
      evidence-based and consensus-based statements for the use of TDM of
      biopharmaceuticals in inflammatory RMDs, addressing the clinical utility of TDM.

      competitors and predators.
PG  - e2648

AB  - Understanding factors that influence animal behavior is central to ecology. Basic
      principles of animal ecology imply that individuals should seek to maximize
      survival and reproduction, which means carefully weighing risk against reward.
      Decisions become increasingly complex and constrained, however, when risk is
      spatiotemporally variable. We advance a growing body of work in predator-prey
      behavior by evaluating novel questions where a prey species is confronted with
      multiple predators and a potential competitor. We tested how fine-scale behavior 
      of female mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus) during the reproductive season shifted 
      depending upon spatial and temporal variation in risk from predators and a
      potential competitor. We expected female deer to avoid areas of high risk when
      movement activity of predators and a competitor were high. We used GPS data
      collected from 76 adult female mule deer, 35 adult female elk, 33 adult coyotes, 
      and six adult mountain lions. Counter to our expectations, female deer exhibited 
      selection for multiple risk factors, however, selection for risk was dampened by 
      the exposure to risk within home ranges of female deer, producing a functional
      response in habitat selection. Furthermore, temporal variation in movement
      activity of predators and elk across the diel cycle did not result in a shift in 
      movement activity by female deer. Instead, the average level of risk within their
      home range was the predominant factor modulating the response to risk by female
      deer. Our results counter prevailing hypotheses of how large herbivores navigate 
      risky landscapes and emphasize the importance of accounting for the local
      environment when identifying effects of risk on animal behavior. Moreover, our
      findings highlight additional behavioral mechanisms used by large herbivores to
      mitigate multiple sources of predation and potential competitive interactions.

AB  - Ectodermal dysplasia (ED) involves the aberrant development of at least two
      ectodermal derivatives, such as skin, teeth, hair, sweat glands, and ocular
      tissue. The group of over 200 conditions is commonly classified into two major
      types: hypohidrotic/anhidrotic ED, in which sweat glands are either absent or
      significantly reduced, and hidrotic ED, in which sweat glands are normal. Ocular 
      manifestations pertinent to patients undergoing corneal vision correction surgery
      include multifaceted dry eye syndrome, corneal pathology, such as recurrent
      erosions, scars, neovascularization, and limbal stem cell deficiency, and
      early-onset cataracts and glaucoma. In this article we discuss the current
      understanding of ED and offer factors to consider when these patients are seeking
      corneal refractive surgery.

AB  - The Galapagos sea lion (Zalophus wollebaeki) is an endemic pinniped to the
      Galapagos archipelago, and like most wild mammals, is at risk for anemia due to
      trauma, infectious disease, and poor nutrition. This study evaluated the health
      status of 26 juvenile Galapagos sea lions on the island of San Cristobal prior to
      evaluating 100 crossmatch combinations. On evaluation, all but one sea lion had
      no major systemic abnormalities. Of the 100 crossmatches performed, 23% had minor
      reactions. The most significant reaction was weak macroscopic agglutination found
      in 4% of samples. The small percentage of agglutination reactions suggests a
      small proportion of naturally occurring alloantibodies in this species and may be
      consistent with a low risk of acute immune-mediated hemolytic transfusion
      reaction.

TI  - Developing Immune Profiles of Endangered Australian Sea Lion (Neophoca cinerea)
      Pups Within the Context of Endemic Hookworm (Uncinaria sanguinis) Infection.
PG  - 824584
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2022.824584 [doi]
AB  - As a top predator, the endangered Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) is a
      sentinel of ecosystem change, where population trends can reflect broader shifts 
      in the marine environment. The population of this endemic pinniped was
      historically diminished by commercial sealing, and recovery has been slowed by
      fishery interactions, disease and, potentially, pollutants. Hookworm infects 100%
      of neonatal pups and has been identified as a contributor to population decline. 
      Here, a multivariable approach using traditional serological and novel molecular 
      tools such as qPCR and ddPCR was used to examine immune phenotypes of developing 
      Australian sea lion pups infected with the endemic hookworm (Uncinaria sanguinis)
      from two South Australian colonies. Results show changing immunophenotypes
      throughout the patent period of infection represented by pro-inflammatory
      cytokines (IL-6), IgG and acute-phase proteins. Although cytokines may prove
      useful as markers of resistance, in this study, IL-6 is determined to be an early
      biomarker of inflammation in Australian sea lion pups, excluding the alternative 
      hypothesis. Additionally, immunological differences between animals from high-
      and low-intensity hookworm seasons, as well as ivermectin-treated animals,
      indicate hookworm infection modulation of the host immune response, as evidenced 
      by a lower IL-6 mRNA expression in the non-treated groups. This study of the
      Australian sea lion is an example of an ecoimmunological approach to disease
      investigation, which can be applied to evaluate the impact of environmental and
      anthropogenic factors on susceptibility to infectious diseases in free-ranging
      species.

TI  - Human-Wildlife Conflict in Save Valley Conservancy: Residents' Attitude Toward
      Wildlife Conservation.
PG  - 2107711
LID - 10.1155/2022/2107711 [doi]
AB  - Human settlement in protected areas (PAs) is a major conservation concern in
      developing nations as it fuels human-wildlife conflicts (HWCs). The objectives of
      this study were to (i) determine the key wildlife species causing conflict, (ii) 
      assess the perceptions of residents toward the major causes of conflict with
      wildlife, and (iii) evaluate the attitudes of residents toward problem animals.
      We conducted face-to-face semistructured interviews and two reconnaissance field 
      surveys with 290 respondents residing in Save Valley Conservancy (SVC), in
      Southeast Lowveld Zimbabwe from January 2014 to June 2014. Results showed that
      lions (Panthera leo), spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta), elephants (Loxodonta
      africana), and Nile crocodiles (Crocodylus niloticus) were the major animals
      involved in the conflict. Our results also showed that the land-use change from
      wildlife ranching to farming and contested land ownership were perceived as the
      major causes of HWCs. Respondents who had lived in the area longer were more
      likely to agree that change in land use (Ordinal logistic regression: B = 1.32,
      Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.74) and contested land ownership (B = .67, OR = 1.95) were
      major sources of conflict. In addition, increased encounters between people and
      wildlife triggered mixed attitudes toward problem animals. For example, males
      were less likely to have a negative attitude toward problem animals compared to
      females (Multinomial logistic regression: B = -1.39; OR = .25). Residents who had
      stayed for less than five years were more likely to have a negative attitude
      toward problem animals than those who had stayed longer (B = 3.6; OR = 36.71).
      These results suggest that there is a need to relook at the resettlement pattern 
      because coordinating HWCs and implementing sustainable conservation objectives
      are easy in a well-planned settlement. Stakeholders need to come together and
      create awareness of the use of HWCs mitigations measures.

TI  - Using Single-Photon Emission Computerized Tomography on Patients With Positive
      Quantitative Electroencephalogram to Evaluate Chronic Mild Traumatic Brain Injury
      With Persistent Symptoms.
PG  - 704844
LID - 10.3389/fneur.2022.704844 [doi]
AB  - Background: Following mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), also known as
      concussion, many patients with chronic symptoms (>3 months post injury) receive
      conventional imaging such as computed tomography (CT) or magnetic resonance
      imaging (MRI). However, these modalities often do not show changes after mTBI. We
      studied the benefit of triaging patients with ongoing symptoms >3 months post
      injury by quantitative electroencephalography (qEEG) and then completing a brain 
      single positron emission computed tomography (SPECT) to aid in diagnosis and
      early detection of brain changes. Methods: We conducted a retrospective case
      review of 30 outpatients with mTBI. The patients were assessed by a neurologist, 
      consented, and received a qEEG, and if the qEEG was positive, they consented and 
      received a brain SPECT scan. The cases and diagnostic tools were collectively
      reviewed by a multidisciplinary group of physicians in biweekly team meetings
      including neurology, nuclear medicine, psychiatry, neuropsychiatry, general
      practice psychotherapy, neuro-ophthalmology, and chiropractic providers. The team
      noted the cause of injury, post injury symptoms, relevant past medical history,
      physical examination findings, and diagnoses, and commented on patients' SPECT
      scans. We then analyzed the SPECT scans quantitatively using the 3D-SSP software.
      Results: All the patients had cerebral perfusion abnormalities demonstrated by
      SPECT that were mostly undetectable by conventional imaging (CT/MRI). Perfusion
      changes were localized primarily in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, and
      cingulate cortex, and correlated with the patients' symptoms and examination
      findings. Qualitative and quantitative analyses yielded similar results. Most
      commonly, the patients experienced persistent headache, memory loss,
      concentration difficulties, depression, and cognitive impairment post mTBI.
      Because of their symptoms, most of the patients were unable to return to their
      previous employment and activity level. Conclusion: Our findings outline the
      physical basis of neurological and psychiatric symptoms experienced by patients
      with mTBI. Increased detection of mTBI can lead to development of improved
      targeted treatments for mTBI and its various sequelae.

TI  - ROLLIS roll-out: Pitfalls, errors, lessons learned and recommendations from
      Australian and New Zealand experience during the randomised controlled trial,
      implementing a novel localisation method for impalpable malignant breast lesions,
      radio-guided occult lesion localisation with iodine-125 ((125) I) seed (ROLLIS).
LID - 10.1111/1754-9485.13418 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Breast cancer surgery aims to excise lesions with clear margins and
      provide optimal cosmesis with a low re-excision rates. These aims are aided by
      accurate lesion localisation and a surgical choice of incision site with minimal 
      removal of healthy tissue. Problems associated with hookwires have led to
      adoption of non-wire methods including radioguided occult lesion localisation
      using iodine-125 (ROLLIS). This paper outlines the problems encountered and
      lessons learnt during the largest RCT involving 659 participants, conducted at
      eight sites (seven Australian, one New Zealand centres) between September 2013
      and April 2018.* METHODS: Data, along with substantive comments, regarding each
      ROLLIS procedure, documenting each step from the seed insertion, ease of
      operative retrieval, to return of the seed to medical physics, from a shared
      on-line secure database and a separate site email survey, were synthesised and
      categorised. RESULTS: The Australian and New Zealand ROLLIS RCT experience
      highlights several important issues. Lessons learned were related to licencing
      the seed and tracking protocols. A Designated Team Lead, who is a good
      communicator, ensuring the Tracking Protocols were accurately followed and
      updated, subspecialty leads and a Co-ordinator, responsible for training, logbook
      maintenance and seed ordering, enhanced the success and acceptance of the
      programme. Addressing radiation issues, fears, education of staff and seed loss
      was imperative. CONCLUSION: The Australian and New Zealand ROLLIS RCT experience 
      highlights the need for adherence to local licencing laws and protocols,
      appointing a dedicated ROLLIS Designated Team Lead with good communication and a 
      ROLLIS Co-ordinator. These facilitate the adoption of a successful ROLLIS
      programme.

TI  - Tumor Lysis Syndrome and AKI: Beyond Crystal Mechanisms.
PG  - 1154-1171

AB  - BACKGROUND: The pathophysiology of AKI during tumor lysis syndrome (TLS) is not
      well understood due to the paucity of data. We aimed to decipher
      crystal-dependent and crystal-independent mechanisms of TLS-induced AKI. METHODS:
      Crystalluria, plasma cytokine levels, and extracellular histones levels were
      measured in two cohorts of patients with TLS. We developed a model of TLS in
      syngeneic mice with acute myeloid leukemia, and analyzed ultrastructural changes 
      in kidneys and endothelial permeability using intravital confocal microscopy. In 
      parallel, we studied the endothelial toxicity of extracellular histones in vitro.
      RESULTS: The study provides the first evidence that previously described
      crystal-dependent mechanisms are insufficient to explain TLS-induced AKI.
      Extracellular histones that are released in huge amounts during TLS caused
      profound endothelial alterations in the mouse model. The mechanisms of
      histone-mediated damage implicates endothelial cell activation mediated by
      Toll-like receptor 4. Heparin inhibits extracellular histones and mitigates
      endothelial dysfunction during TLS. CONCLUSION: This study sheds new light on the
      pathophysiology of TLS-induced AKI and suggests that extracellular histones may
      constitute a novel target for therapeutic intervention in TLS when endothelial
      dysfunction occurs.

TI  - Alpha-Smooth Muscle Actin Expression and Parafoveal Blood Flow Pathways Are
      Altered in Preclinical Diabetic Retinopathy.
PG  - 8
LID - 10.1167/iovs.63.5.8 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: To investigate differences in alpha smooth muscle actin (alphaSMA)
      expression and parafoveal blood flow pathways in diabetic retinopathy (DR).
      Methods: Human donor eyes from healthy subjects (n = 8), patients with diabetes
      but no DR (DR-; n = 7), and patients with clinical DR (DR+; n = 13) were
      perfusion labeled with antibodies targeting alphaSMA, lectin, collagen IV, and
      filamentous actin. High-resolution confocal scanning laser microscopy was used to
      quantify alphaSMA staining and capillary density in the parafoveal circulation.
      Quantitative analyses of connections between retinal arteries and veins within
      the superficial vascular plexus (SVP), intermediate capillary plexus (ICP) and
      deep capillary plexus (DCP) were performed. Results: Mean age between the groups 
      was not different (P = 0.979). alphaSMA staining was seen in the SVP and ICP of
      all groups. The DCP was predominantly devoid of alphaSMA staining in control eyes
      but increased in a disease stage-specific manner in the DR- and DR+ groups. The
      increase in alphaSMA staining was localized to pericytes and endothelia of
      terminal arterioles and adjacent capillary segments. Capillary density was less
      in the DCP in the DR+ group (P < 0.001). ICP of the DR- and DR+ groups received
      more direct arteriole supplies than the control group (P < 0.001). Venous outflow
      pathways were not altered (all P > 0.284). Conclusions: Alterations in alphaSMA
      and vascular inflow pathways in preclinical DR suggest that perfusion
      abnormalities precede structural vascular changes such as capillary loss.
      Preclinical DR may be characterized by a "steal" phenomenon where blood flow is
      preferentially diverted from the SVP to the ICP and DCP.

PG  - 1383-1390
LID - 10.2147/OPTH.S342787 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Selective laser trabeculoplasty is a safe and effective procedure for
      reducing IOP, but its mechanism of action is not fully elucidated. We evaluated
      the morphologic and cellular changes as well as DNA synthesis after SLT treatment
      of human trabecular meshwork (TM) tissue explants. Methods: Corneoscleral rim
      tissues that underwent SLT treatment were compared to control segments that had
      no laser treatment. Light microscopy (LM), transmission electron microscopy
      (TEM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to assess cell
      morphology. The Click-iT 5-ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) imaging kit was used to 
      compare DNA synthesis/cell proliferation with a confocal microscope. All tissues 
      were assessed for vitality. Results: SLT treatment does not reveal notable cell
      damage in the juxtacanalicular (JCT) region, but mildly disrupts superficial
      trabecular beams and uveal TM, ablates TM endothelial cells from the undamaged
      beams as detected by both LM and TEM. This superficial destruction was not
      observed in some SLT treatment spots on higher magnification by SEM. SLT
      treatment increased mitotic activity and DNA synthesis near the lining of
      Schlemm's canal after several days. Conclusion: SLT treatment disrupts
      endothelial cells in the corneoscleral TM and causes superficial ultrastructural 
      changes to the uveal TM. SLT treatment also shows a trend towards dynamic
      time-dependent changes in (DNA synthesis) with an increase in mitotic activity at
      7 days cell proliferation.

AB  - Since 2011, the Gyrovirus galga 1 (GyVg1, previously recognized as avian
      gyrovirus 2) strain has extensively been detected worldwide. The virus has been
      identified in several species, including chickens, humans, domestic cats, and
      snakes, especially in China. Therefore, in this study, the presence of GyVg1 was 
      investigated in various zoo animals to determine whether it exists in various
      species in Nanyang, China. A total of 63 whole blood samples (1 sample from each 
      animal) from 24 animal species were collected from the Nanyang Zoo. Eight
      different GyVg1 strains were identified in eight types of animals using
      polymerase chain reaction, and the full genome of each strain was sequenced. The 
      whole genome of four GyVg1 strains, namely, HN2019-H1, HN2019-T1, HN2019-SD1, and
      HN2019-L1 identified in hippopotamus (Hippopotamus amphibius,), tiger (Panthera
      tigris), sika deer (Cervus nippon), and lion (Panthera leo), respectively,
      comprised 2375 nucleotides (nt). The whole genome of the other strains, namely,
      HN2019-E1, HN2019-S1, HN2019-PF1, and HN2019-P1 identified in egret (Egretta
      garzetta), silver pheasant (Lophura nycthemera), peafowl (Pavonini), and common
      pheasants (Phasianus colchicus), respectively, comprised 2376 nt. Subsequently, a
      phylogenetic tree was constructed based on the 8 whole-genome sequence strains
      and 29 reference strains. These 37 strains were grouped into two major branches, 
      group A and group B, and the 8 strains identified in this study were placed in
      group A. An analysis of the amino acids encoded by three open reading frames
      revealed some mutation sites unique to these eight strains. The substitution
      occurred at site 110 of viral protein 2 of HN2019-PF1, which is located in the
      highly conserved phosphatase motif WX7HX3CXCX5H (95-115aa). Recombination
      analysis revealed that, all these viral sequences were obtained as a result of
      recombination among the three GyVg1 strains (JL1511 and GS1512 from chickens and 
      17CC0810 from cat) from China and two strains (G17 from ferret of Hungary and
      RS-BR-15-2S from chicken of Brazil) from other countries. These findings indicate
      the complex evolution of GyVg1. Nevertheless, its transmission across the hosts
      is worth exploring.

      for nAMD (3802 eyes), DMO (975 eyes), Branch RVO (BRVO, 357 eyes), Central RVO
      (CRVO, 371 eyes) and Hemi-RVO (HRVO, 54 eyes) from 2015 and 2019 tracked in the
      prospectively designed observational Fight Retinal Blindness! Registry. RESULTS: 
      The mean VA change at 12-month for each year between 2015 and 2019 remained
      stable or otherwise showed no discernible trends over time in eyes with nAMD
      (+3.3 to +6 letters), DMO (+3.6 to +6.7 letters) and RVO (+10.3 to +11.7 letters 
      for BRVO, +5.9 to +17.7 letters for CRVO and 10.2 to 20.7 letters for HRVO). The 
      median number of VEGF-inhibitor injections in eyes that completed 12-month
      follow-up also remained stable at 8-9 for nAMD, 6-7 for DMO, 7-9 for RVO. Fewer
      eyes (<one-fourth) that started treatment between 2015 and 2018 and more eyes
      starting in 2019 did not complete 12-month's follow-up visit. The mean VA in
      non-completers at their last visit was higher than that of their baseline visit. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Treatment patterns and outcomes for nAMD, DMO and RVO in routine
      clinical practice have stabilised over the past 5 years at levels inferior to
      those reported by the pivotal phase 3 studies. A conscious effort to treat these 
      conditions more intensively, or with longer lasting agents, would likely improve 
      outcomes further in our patients.

AB  - Anisakidosis is an accidental and cosmopolitan parasitic zoonosis of human
      beings, its definitive host being marine mammals such as sea lions, seals and
      dolphins, among others. Humans are infested by consumption in the larval stage of
      the nematode of Anisakis present in raw fish and shellfish such as hake or conger
      eel. The infestation is preferably located in the upper digestive tract,
      observing the regurgitation of the parasite to the mouth or becoming evident
      during an upper gastrointestinal endoscopy. In rare cases, the larvae can migrate
      to the peritoneum or continue their passage through the small intestine and
      colon, with expulsion in stools being unusual. We present a case of expulsion of 
      two larvae of the Anisakidae family in feces.

TI  - Twelve natural estrogens in urines of six threatened or endangered mammalian
      species in Zoo Park: implications and their potential risk.
PG  - 49404-49410
LID - 10.1007/s11356-022-20554-x [doi]
AB  - This work was the first to report twelve natural estrogens (NEs) in the urines of
      six threatened or endangered mammalians in a Zoo Park of Guangzhou (i.e., panda, 
      gorilla, elephant, African lion, jaguar, and leopard). Ten out of twelve NEs were
      detected at least in one urine sample of the six mammalians studied, including
      the four major NEs (i.e., estrone (E1), 17beta-estradiol (E2), 17alpha-estradiol 
      (alphaE2), estriol (E3)), and six other NEs (i.e., 4-hydroxyestrone (4OHE1),
      2-hydroxyestradiol (2OHE2), 4-hydroxyestradiol (4OHE2), 16alpha-hydroxyestrone
      (16alpha-OHE1), 16ketoestradiol (16ketoE2), and 17epiestriol (17epiE3)). The six 
      studied mammalians, ranked in the order of high to low urinary concentration of
      total NEs, were jaguar, African lion, gorilla, elephant, panda, and leopard, with
      respective urinary concentrations of 110.4, 86.4, 71.4, 66.0, 55.9, and 52.8
      ng/mL. According to the average urinary concentration of NE in the six mammalians
      ranked from high to low, the top five NEs detected were 16alpha-OHE1, 4OHE1, E1, 
      E3, and 17epiE3, respectively. These clearly indicated the occurrence of NEs
      other than the four major types in urines of animals in a Zoo Park. Moreover, the
      daily excretion rates of the five detected NEs by one elephant ranged from
      1162-2254 mug/d with a total daily excretion rate of 8260 mug/d, suggesting that 
      the total urinary excretion of NEs by one adult elephant was equivalent to that
      by 170 premenopausal women or 506 adult men. Consequently, it appears from this
      study that NEs in the urines of zoo animals should be considered an emerging
      source of NEs.

TI  - Intraocular Pressure Measurement with Pneumatonometry and a Tonometer Tip Cover
      During Negative Pressure Application.
PG  - 1289-1300
LID - 10.2147/OPTH.S359605 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: This is a 2-part study to investigate the agreement between
      pneumatonometry and direct pressure transducer intraocular pressure (IOP)
      measurements in a perfusion organ culture (POC) model where (1) the perfusion
      fluid column is open to atmospheric pressure, holding IOP constant to permit
      evaluation of the impact of negative pressure (NP) on IOP measurements, and (2)
      the perfusion fluid column is a closed system, allowing IOP to vary with NP
      application. Methods: The first part incorporated a fluid column open to
      atmospheric pressure, maintaining IOP constant to permit evaluation of the effect
      of applied NP on IOP measurement accuracy. In the second part, the POC column was
      closed, allowing IOP to vary with NP application and permit evaluation of
      agreement between pneumatonometry and pressure transducer measurements. In each
      part, four perfused tissues were used in thirteen paired pre-set IOP (10, 20, 25,
      30 mmHg) and NP (0, 5, 10, 15, 20 mmHg) combinations, resulting in a total of
      1040 paired measurements (520 per study). The difference in IOP measurements
      (Delta IOP = Excursion tonometry - pressure transducer) was calculated at each
      paired configuration. Results: During the first part, the mean Delta IOP was -0.7
      +/- 1.6 mmHg across all measurements. During the second part, the mean Delta IOP 
      across all measurements was +0.7 +/- 1.4 mmHg. At NP settings of -5, -10, -15,
      and -20 mmHg, across all pre-set IOPs, the mean IOP reduction via Excursion
      tonometry was 3.1 +/- 0.3, 5.6 +/- 1.3, 8.5 +/- 1.7 and 11.2 +/- 1.8 mmHg,
      respectively. Conclusion: Measurement of IOP via Excursion tonometry yields
      results within the accuracy range of the pneumatonometry device (per
      manufacturer) and is minimally impacted by NP application. The IOP-lowering
      results are consistent with previous studies and further support the
      effectiveness of the Multi-Pressure Dial in lowering IOP relative to atmospheric 
      pressure.

LID - 10.4103/ijo.IJO_2785_21 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: : To determine the prevalence of diabetic retinopathy (DR) and its risk 
      factors among diabetic patients in the states of Madhya Pradesh (MP) and
      Chhattisgarh (CG). Methods: : Diabetic patients were screened in the treating
      diabetologist/physician's clinic by a team that included an ophthalmologist, an
      optometrist, and a counselor. Demographic details, diabetic control, compliance
      to eye checkup, awareness regarding diabetic blindness, and visual acuity were
      recorded using a questionnaire. DR was graded both by indirect ophthalmoscopy and
      fundus photo taken with a portable fundus camera. Results: : In total, 602
      subjects were screened across five selected locations of MP and CG. The
      prevalence of DR was 13.62%. No significant difference with gender was seen. The 
      presence and grade of DR were related to age, diabetic age, and diabetic control.
      Conclusion: : This study provides the prevalence data for DR among diabetic
      patients from the states of MP and CG and highlights important barriers to DR
      screening in our country.

TI  - Sabertooth carcass consumption behavior and the dynamics of Pleistocene large
      carnivoran guilds.
PG  - 6045
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-09480-7 [doi]
AB  - Apex predators play an important role in the top-down regulation of ecological
      communities. Their hunting and feeding behaviors influence, respectively, prey
      demography and the availability of resources to other consumers. Among the most
      iconic-and enigmatic-terrestrial predators of the late Cenozoic are the
      Machairodontinae, a diverse group of big cats whose hypertrophied upper canines
      have earned them the moniker "sabertooths." Many aspects of these animals'
      paleobiology, especially their prey preferences and carcass consumption behavior,
      remain unsettled. While skeletal anatomy, dental morphology and wear, and
      isotopic profiles provide important insights, the most direct way to resolve
      these issues is through the fossil remains of sabertooth prey. Here, we report on
      a taphonomic analysis of an early Pleistocene faunal assemblage from Haile 21A
      (Florida, USA) that preserves feeding damage from the lion-sized sabertooth
      Xenosmilus hodsonae. Patterns of tooth-marking and bone damage indicate that
      Xenosmilus fully defleshed the carcasses of their prey and even engaged in some
      minor bone consumption. This has important implications for Pleistocene
      carnivoran guild dynamics, including the carcass foraging behavior of the first
      stone-tool-using hominins.

TI  - Encapsulation of BSA in hybrid PEG hydrogels: stability and controlled release.
PG  - 30887-30897
LID - 10.1039/d1ra03547a [doi]
AB  - Hybrid hydrogels based on silylated polyethylene glycol, Si-PEG, were evaluated
      as hybrid matrices able to trap, stabilize and release bovine serum albumin (BSA)
      in a controlled manner. Parameters of the inorganic condensation reaction leading
      to a siloxane (Si-O-Si) three dimensional network were carefully investigated, in
      particular the temperature, the surrounding hygrometry and the Si-PEG
      concentration. The resulting hydrogel structural features affected the stability,
      swelling, and mechanical properties of the network, leading to different protein 
      release profiles. Elongated polymer assemblies were observed, the length of which
      ranged from 150 nm to over 5 mum. The length could be correlated to the Si-O-Si
      condensation rate from 60% (hydrogels obtained at 24 degrees C) to about 90%
      (xerogels obtained at 24 degrees C), respectively. Consequently, the controlled
      release of BSA could be achieved from hours to several weeks, with respect to the
      fibers' length and the condensation rate. The protein stability was evaluated by 
      means of a thermal study. The main results gave insight into the biomolecule
      structure preservation during polymerisation, with DeltaG < 0 for encapsulated
      BSA in any conditions, below the melting temperature (65 degrees C).

TI  - Experimental and natural infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related

AB  - The severe acute respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has
      spread globally and has led to extremely high mortality rates. In addition to
      infecting humans, this virus also has infected animals. Experimental studies and 
      natural infections showed that dogs have a low susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2
      infection, whereas domesticated cats and other animals in the family Felidae,
      such as lions, tigers, snow leopards, and cougars, have a high susceptibility to 
      viral infections. In addition, wild white-tailed deer, gorillas, and otters have 
      been found to be infected by SARS-CoV-2. Furry farm animals, such as minks, have 
      a high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. The virus appears to spread among 
      minks and generate several new mutations, resulting in increased viral virulence.
      Furthermore, livestock animals, such as cattle, sheep, and pigs, were found to
      have low susceptibility to the virus, whereas chicken, ducks, turkeys, quail, and
      geese did not show susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 infection. This knowledge can
      provide insights for the development of SARS-CoV-2 mitigation strategies in
      animals and humans. Therefore, this review focuses on experimental (both
      replication and transmission) in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo studies of
      SARS-CoV-2 infections in pets and in wild and farm animals, and to provide
      details on the mechanism associated with natural infection.

TI  - Oxytocin promotes social proximity and decreases vigilance in groups of African
      lions.
PG  - 104049
LID - 10.1016/j.isci.2022.104049 [doi]
AB  - Oxytocin modulates mammalian social behavior; however, behavioral responses to
      intranasal oxytocin can vary across species and contexts. The complexity of
      social interactions increases with group dynamics, and the impacts of oxytocin on
      both within- and between-group contexts are unknown. We tested the effects of
      intranasal administration of oxytocin on social and non-social behaviors within
      in-group and out-group contexts in African lions. We hypothesized that, post
      intranasal oxytocin administration, lions would be in closer proximity with
      fellow group members, whereas out-group stimuli could either produce a heightened
      vigilance response or an attenuated one. Compared to control trials, post
      oxytocin administration, lions increased their time spent in close proximity
      (reducing their distance to the nearest neighbor) and decreased vigilance toward 
      out-group intruders (reducing their vocalizations following a roar-playback).
      These results not only have important implications for understanding the
      evolution of social circuitry but may also have practical applications for
      conservation efforts.

TI  - Does Time of Administration of Intravenous Ketorolac Impact Pain-Related Outcomes
      in Dacryocystorhinostomy?
PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1080/01676830.2022.2058021 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: An emerging body of evidence indicates that intravenous ketorolac (IVK) 
      reduces pain scores and the requirement for opioid analgesics in a variety of
      oculofacial procedures. This study was performed to assess the impact of timing
      of IVK administration on these benefits after external dacryocystorhinostomy
      (DCR). METHODS: Patients were randomized to receive IVK before (n = 50), during
      (n = 50), or after DCR (n = 50). An additional cohort of control patients did not
      receive the medication (n = 50). Postoperative pain was measured via a visual
      analog scale immediately after DCR on the first day after surgery (POD1).
      Additionally, the need for opioid analgesics to control pain was recorded.
      Statistical analyses were performed via a dedicated computerized software
      package. RESULTS: Immediately after surgery, mean pain scores were 5.26 for
      control patients, and 2.30, 2.44, and 2.36 for patients that received IVK pre-,
      intra-, and post-operatively, respectively (p < .001 for each condition, as
      compared to controls). On POD1, mean pain scores were 3.52 for control patients
      and 1.38, 1.32, and 1.28 for patients that received IVK pre-, intra-, and
      post-operatively, respectively (p < .001 for each condition, as compared to
      controls). 28% of control patients required postoperative opioid analgesics, as
      compared to 6%, 4%, and 4% among patients that received IVK pre-, intra-, and
      postoperatively, respectively (p < .05 for each condition, as compared to
      controls). CONCLUSIONS: IVK significantly reduces postoperative pain and the
      requirement for opioid analgesics after DCR, regardless of the timing of
      administration. This benefit appears to extend into the first postoperative day.

AB  - Cognitive ability is likely linked to adaptive ability; animals use cognition to 
      innovate and problem-solve in their physical and social environments. We
      investigated innovative problem-solving in two species of high conservation
      importance: African lions (Panthera leo; n = 6) and snow leopards (Panthera
      uncia; n = 9). We designed a custom multi-access puzzle box (MAB) to present a
      simple and effective behavioral test for the cats to explore. We measured
      Repeated Innovation, Persistence, Success, Contact Latency, and the Exploration
      Diversity of individuals interacting with the MAB. Of the six African lions,
      three (50%) solved one door to the box, one solved two doors (16.67%), and one
      solved three doors (16.67%). Of the nine snow leopards, one solved one door
      (11.11%), three solved two doors (33.33%), and none solved all three doors (0%). 
      Persistence was a significant predictor of Success in African lions and snow
      leopards; more Persistent individuals were more likely to open a door. We also
      observed significant individual variation in Persistence for both species, but
      only snow leopards also exhibited differences in Contact Latency and Exploration 
      Diversity. These results suggest individuals vary in their problem-solving
      approaches. Our findings support both species as successful, repeated innovators.
      Carnivores face ecological and social challenges and, presumably, benefit from
      cognitive abilities facilitating the successful navigation of these challenges in
      captivity and the wild.

AB  - Uremic leontiasis ossea (ULO) is a rare disease characterized by extensive
      thickening of the cranium, resulting in a characteristic, lion-like facial
      appearance. It is considered the most severe osseous complication of renal
      dystrophy. Although rare, ULO can occur even in young patients, which can be
      catastrophic, as it can not only lead to life-threatening conditions but also
      multiple complications that cause severe determent to the quality of life.

      the era of COVID-19.
PG  - 198-201
LID - 10.2334/josnusd.21-0539 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To clarify the effect of mouth-closed tooth brushing on the suppression 
      of droplet generation in comparison with ordinary (mouth-open) tooth brushing and
      to investigate the difference in plaque removal efficacy between mouth-open and
      mouth-closed tooth brushing. METHODS: Fourteen adults participated in the study. 
      The labial/buccal, lingual, and occlusal surfaces of each sextant were brushed
      with the mouth open and closed, and a high-sensitivity camera and a high-power
      light source were used to measure the number of generated droplets. The plaque
      removal efficacy of each type of tooth brushing was evaluated according to the
      O'Leary Plaque Control Record. RESULTS: Significantly more droplets were
      generated by mouth-open brushing than by mouth-closed brushing. The number of
      droplets was highest when the lingual surfaces of the upper anterior sextants
      were brushed with the mouth open. In mouth-closed brushing, almost no droplets
      were observed from any region. The plaque removal rate with each type of brushing
      did not differ significantly among any regions except the lingual surfaces of the
      upper left sextant. CONCLUSION: Mouth-closed tooth brushing almost completely
      suppressed droplet generation and did not reduce the plaque removal efficacy.
      Therefore, mouth-closed tooth brushing is beneficial as an oral hygiene method
      during coronavirus disease 2019 outbreaks.

AB  - Cardiac disease is the predominant cause of global death mainly due to its hidden
      symptoms and late diagnosis. Hence, early detection is important to improve
      quality of life. Though traditional researches attempted to predict heart
      disease, most of them lacked with respect to accuracy. To solve this, the present
      study proposes a hybridized Ant Lion Crow Search Optimization Genetic Algorithm
      (ALCSOGA) to perform effective feature selection. This hybrid optimization
      encompasses Ant Lion, Crow Search and Genetic Algorithm. Ant lion algorithm
      determines the elite position. While, the Crow Search Algorithm utilizes the
      phenomenon of position and memory of each crow for evaluating the objective
      function. Both these algorithms are fed into Genetic Algorithm to improve the
      performance of feature selection process. Then, Stochastic Learning rate
      optimized Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) is proposed to classify the extracted
      optimized features. Finally, comparative analysis is performed in terms of
      accuracy, recall, F1-score, and precision. Moreover, statistical analysis is
      performed with respect to Sum of Squares (SS), degree of freedom (df), F Critical
      (F crit), F Statistics (F), p, and Mean Square (MS) value. Analytical results
      revealed the efficiency of proposed system over conventional methods and thereby 
      confirming its efficiency for predicting heart disease.

TI  - Whole genome sequencing and the application of a SNP panel reveal primary
      evolutionary lineages and genomic variation in the lion (Panthera leo).
PG  - 321
LID - 10.1186/s12864-022-08510-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Previous phylogeographic studies of the lion (Panthera leo) have
      improved our insight into the distribution of genetic variation, as well as a
      revised taxonomy which now recognizes a northern (Panthera leo leo) and a
      southern (Panthera leo melanochaita) subspecies. However, existing whole range
      phylogeographic studies on lions either consist of very limited numbers of
      samples, or are focused on mitochondrial DNA and/or a limited set of
      microsatellites. The geographic extent of genetic lineages and their phylogenetic
      relationships remain uncertain, clouded by massive sampling gaps, sex-biased
      dispersal and incomplete lineage sorting. RESULTS: In this study we present
      results of low depth whole genome sequencing and subsequent variant calling in
      ten lions sampled throughout the geographic range, resulting in the discovery of 
      >150,000 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs). Phylogenetic analyses revealed
      the same basal split between northern and southern populations, as well as four
      population clusters on a more local scale. Further, we designed a SNP panel,
      including 125 autosomal and 14 mitochondrial SNPs, which was tested on >200 lions
      from across their range. Results allow us to assign individuals to one of these
      four major clades (West & Central Africa, India, East Africa, or Southern Africa)
      and delineate these clades in more detail. CONCLUSIONS: The results presented
      here, particularly the validated SNP panel, have important applications, not only
      for studying populations on a local geographic scale, but also for tracing
      samples of unknown origin for forensic purposes, and for guiding conservation
      management of ex situ populations. Thus, these genomic resources not only
      contribute to our understanding of the evolutionary history of the lion, but may 
      also play a crucial role in conservation efforts aimed at protecting the species 
      in its full diversity.

TI  - The Legacy of the TTASAAN Report-Premature Conclusions and Forgotten Promises: A 
      Review of Policy and Practice Part I.

AB  - Brain perfusion single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) scans were
      initially developed in 1970's. A key radiopharmaceutical,
      hexamethylpropyleneamine oxime (HMPAO), was originally approved in 1988, but was 
      unstable. As a result, the quality of SPECT images varied greatly based on
      technique until 1993, when a method of stabilizing HMPAO was developed. In
      addition, most SPECT perfusion studies pre-1996 were performed on single-head
      gamma cameras. In 1996, the Therapeutics and Technology Assessment Subcommittee
      of the American Academy of Neurology (TTASAAN) issued a report regarding the use 
      of SPECT in the evaluation of neurological disorders. Although the TTASAAN report
      was published in January 1996, it was approved for publication in October 1994.
      Consequently, the reported brain SPECT studies relied upon to derive the
      conclusions of the TTASAAN report largely pre-date the introduction of stabilized
      HMPAO. While only 12% of the studies on traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the
      TTASAAN report utilized stable tracers and multi-head cameras, 69 subsequent
      studies with more than 23,000 subjects describe the utility of perfusion SPECT
      scans in the evaluation of TBI. Similarly, dementia SPECT imaging has improved.
      Modern SPECT utilizing multi-headed gamma cameras and quantitative analysis has a
      sensitivity of 86% and a specificity of 89% for the diagnosis of mild to moderate
      Alzheimer's disease-comparable to fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission
      tomography. Advances also have occurred in seizure neuroimaging. Lastly,
      developments in SPECT imaging of neurotoxicity and neuropsychiatric disorders
      have been striking. At the 25-year anniversary of the publication of the TTASAAN 
      report, it is time to re-examine the utility of perfusion SPECT brain imaging.
      Herein, we review studies cited by the TTASAAN report vs. current brain SPECT
      imaging research literature for the major indications addressed in the report, as
      well as for emerging indications. In Part II, we elaborate technical aspects of
      SPECT neuroimaging and discuss scan interpretation for the clinician.

TI  - Development of a Chimeric Porcine Reproductive and Respiratory Syndrome Virus
      (PRRSV)-2 Vaccine Candidate Expressing Hypo-Glycosylated Glycoprotein-5
      Ectodomain of Korean Lineage-1 Strain.
LID - 165 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vetsci9040165 [doi]
AB  - Vaccination is a practical method to provide protection against porcine
      reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), but current PRRSV vaccines
      show limited efficacy against divergent field strains. Lineage 1 PRRSV includes
      virulent strains such as NADC30 and MN184 and now has become one of the most
      prevalent viruses in Korea. Accordingly, there is an urgent need to develop a new
      vaccine for Korean lineage-1 strains. In this study, a vaccine candidate against 
      Korean lineage-1 PRRSV, vCSL1-GP5-N33D, was developed by reverse genetics
      technology. vCSL1-GP5-N33D was designed as a hypo-glycosylated chimeric virus
      containing the glycoprotein 5 ectodomain region of the Korean lineage-1 wild-type
      strain. An inactivated vaccine of vCSL1-GP5-N33D was applied to a PRRS-endemic
      farm and elicited high serum virus neutralization (SVN) antibody titers. The
      vaccinated group induced SVN antibody titers of 4.40 (log2) +/- 2.46, which were 
      approximately 2-fold higher than those of the negative control at 8-weeks
      post-vaccination. Moreover, 60% of pigs in the vaccinated group displayed SVN
      antibody titers of >/=5 (log2), while none of the pigs in the negative control
      exhibited SVN antibody titers of >/=5 (log2). The overall results of the animal
      experiment suggest that the vCSL1-GP5-N33D inactivated vaccine is a promising
      vaccine candidate.

TI  - Convolutional Neural Networks for the Identification of African Lions from
      Individual Vocalizations.
LID - 96 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jimaging8040096 [doi]
AB  - The classification of vocal individuality for passive acoustic monitoring (PAM)
      and census of animals is becoming an increasingly popular area of research.
      Nearly all studies in this field of inquiry have relied on classic audio
      representations and classifiers, such as Support Vector Machines (SVMs) trained
      on spectrograms or Mel-Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs). In contrast, most
      current bioacoustic species classification exploits the power of deep learners
      and more cutting-edge audio representations. A significant reason for avoiding
      deep learning in vocal identity classification is the tiny sample size in the
      collections of labeled individual vocalizations. As is well known, deep learners 
      require large datasets to avoid overfitting. One way to handle small datasets
      with deep learning methods is to use transfer learning. In this work, we evaluate
      the performance of three pretrained CNNs (VGG16, ResNet50, and AlexNet) on a
      small, publicly available lion roar dataset containing approximately 150 samples 
      taken from five male lions. Each of these networks is retrained on eight
      representations of the samples: MFCCs, spectrogram, and Mel spectrogram, along
      with several new ones, such as VGGish and stockwell, and those based on the
      recently proposed LM spectrogram. The performance of these networks, both
      individually and in ensembles, is analyzed and corroborated using the Equal Error
      Rate and shown to surpass previous classification attempts on this dataset; the
      best single network achieved over 95% accuracy and the best ensembles over 98%
      accuracy. The contributions this study makes to the field of individual vocal
      classification include demonstrating that it is valuable and possible, with
      caution, to use transfer learning with single pretrained CNNs on the small
      datasets available for this problem domain. We also make a contribution to
      bioacoustics generally by offering a comparison of the performance of many
      state-of-the-art audio representations, including for the first time the LM
      spectrogram and stockwell representations. All source code for this study is

TI  - Association of Novel Loci With Keratoconus Susceptibility in a Multitrait
      Genome-Wide Association Study of the UK Biobank Database and Canadian
      Longitudinal Study on Aging.
PG  - 568-576
LID - 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2022.0891 [doi]
AB  - Importance: Keratoconus can be a debilitating corneal ectasia in which the cornea
      thins, bulges, and steepens into a conical shape. Early features of keratoconus
      include myopia and irregular astigmatism, which affect vision and can be treated 
      with contact lenses, collagen cross-linking, or, in advanced cases, corneal
      transplant. Recent estimates of the prevalence of keratoconus based on results of
      Scheimpflug imaging in young adults are as high as 1.2%. However, obtaining very 
      large keratoconus data sets for a genome-wide association study (GWAS) is
      problematic because few population studies include Scheimpflug imaging and
      because severe keratoconus is relatively rare. Objective: To identify novel
      keratoconus loci using corneal resistance factor (CRF) and central corneal
      thickness (CCT). Design, Setting, and Participants: This multitrait GWAS used
      European ancestry CRF data from UK Biobank (UKB) (n = 105 427) and the Canadian
      Longitudinal Study on Aging (CLSA) (n = 18307) and European ancestry CCT data
      from the International Glaucoma Genetics Consortium (IGGC) (n = 17803). The CRF
      and CCT variants in published keratoconus data sets (4669 cases and 116547
      controls) were compared. The data set from UKB was compiled March 24, 2020; data 
      were released from the CLSA in July 2020; and IGGC data were available from May
      1, 2018. Main Outcomes and Measures: Association of CRF and CCT variants with
      keratoconus risk. Results: The GWAS included 4 cohorts: 105427 UKB European
      ancestry (56 134 women [53.2%] and 49 293 men [46.7%]; mean [SD] age, 57 [8]
      years), 5029 UKB South Asian ancestry (2368 women [47.1%] and 2661 men [52.9%];
      mean [SD] age, 54 [8] years), 902 UKB East Asian ancestry (622 women [68.9%] and 
      280 men [31.0%]; mean [SD] age, 53 [8] years), and 18307 CLSA European ancestry
      (9260 women [50.6%] and 9047 men [49.4%]; mean [SD] age, 63 [10] years)
      participants. A total of 369 CRF and 233 CCT loci were identified, including 36
      novel CRF loci and 114 novel CCT loci. Twenty-nine CRF loci and 24 CCT loci were 
      associated with keratoconus. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) were constructed using
      CRF- and CCT-associated variants and published keratoconus variants. The PRS
      result showed that adding a CRF- or CCT-based PRS to the keratoconus PRS from
      previously published variants improved the prediction area under the receiver
      operating characteristic curve (from 0.705 to 0.756 for CRF and from 0.715 to
      0.755 for CCT). Conclusions and Relevance: These findings support the use of
      multitrait modeling of corneal parameters in a relatively large data set to
      identify new keratoconus risk loci and enhance polygenic risk score models.

      Neovascularization With Corresponding Histology.
PG  - 628-633
LID - 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2022.0890 [doi]
AB  - Importance: By validating optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) in the 
      analysis of type 3 macular neovascularization secondary to age-related macular
      degeneration, the overall value of clinical OCTA for disease observation,
      diagnosis, and staging is increased. Objective: To assess the association of in
      vivo OCTA of type 3 macular neovascularization secondary to age-related macular
      degeneration with corresponding ex vivo histology. Design, Setting, and
      Participants: This study included clinical imaging, laboratory microscopy, and
      eye-tracked clinicopathologic correlation of a single case from a community-based
      practice evaluated at a university-based research laboratory from 2014 to 2019.
      Exposures: Infrared reflectance and eye-tracked spectral-domain OCTA clinical
      imaging was correlated with ex vivo high-resolution histologic images of the
      preserved donor eye. Eye tracking, applied to the donor eye, enabled
      identification of histologic features corresponding with clinical OCTA
      signatures. Projection artifact removal based on 2-dimensional vessel-shape
      estimation and a Gaussian blur filter demonstrated a robust preservation of
      neovascular flow signal. Main Outcomes and Measures: Histology findings
      associated with clinical OCTA signatures. Three-dimensional view of
      neovascularization via video. Results: A White woman in her 90s with type 3
      neovascularization secondary to age-related macular degeneration was treated with
      37 intravitreal injections of ranibizumab and aflibercept in the right eye. The
      index lesion displayed a drusenoid pigment epithelium detachment, characteristic 
      of type 3 neovascularization. OCTA decorrelation signal in the index lesion
      corresponded in histology to a collagen-ensheathed vascular complex contacting
      basal laminar deposit that outlasted the retinal pigment epithelium. The
      subretinal pigment epithelium-basal laminar space contained calcified material
      and glial processes. No connection between the choriocapillaris and this space
      was observed. Video showed a columnar tangle of flow signal in the outer nuclear 
      layer, with inflow and outflow vessels connecting to the superficial artery and
      vein. Conclusions and Relevance: While this study presents only 1 case in which a
      vascular connection between subretinal pigment epithelium-basal laminar space and
      choriocapillaris was undetected, these results support the potential value of
      OCTA for diagnosis. OCTA decorrelation signal of type 3 neovascularization
      corresponded with intraretinal neovessels on histology. Projection artifact
      removal based on 2-dimensional vessel-shape estimation and Gaussian blur filter
      demonstrated their potential value for further use in OCTA decorrelation signal
      processing.

TI  - Impact of Reference Center Choice on Adaptive Optics Imaging Cone Mosaic
      Analysis.

AB  - Purpose: Foveal center marking is a key step in retinal image analysis. We
      investigated the discordance between the adaptive optics (AO) montage center
      (AMC) and the foveal pit center (FPC) and its implications for cone mosaic
      analysis using a commercial flood-illumination AO camera. Methods: Thirty eyes of
      30 individuals (including 15 healthy and 15 patients with rod-cone dystrophy)
      were included. Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography was used to determine
      the FPC, and flood-illumination AO imaging was performed with overlapping image
      frames to create an AO montage. The AMC was determined by averaging the (0,0)
      coordinates in the four paracentral overlapping AO image frames. Cone mosaic
      measurements at various retinal eccentricities were compared between
      corresponding retinal loci relative to the AMC or FPC. Results: AMCs were located
      temporally to the FPCs in 14 of 15 eyes in both groups. The average AMC-FPC
      discordance was 0.85 degrees among healthy controls and 0.33 degrees among
      patients with rod-cone dystrophy (P < 0.05). The distance of the AMC from the FPC
      was a significant determinant of the cone density (beta estimate = 218
      cells/deg2/deg; 95% confidence interval [CI], 107-330; P < 0.001) and inter-cone 
      distance (beta estimate = 0.28 arcmin/deg; 95% CI, 0.15-0.40; P < 0.001), after
      adjustment for age, sex, axial length, spherical equivalent, eccentricity, and
      disease status. Conclusions: There is a marked mismatch between the AMC and FPC
      in healthy eyes that may be modified by disease process such as rod-cone
      dystrophy. We recommend users of AO imaging systems carefully align the AO
      montage with a foveal anatomical landmark, such as the FPC, to ensure precise and
      reproducible localization of the eccentricities and regions of interest for cone 
      mosaic analysis.

TI  - Bempegaldesleukin plus nivolumab in first-line renal cell carcinoma: results from
      the PIVOT-02 study.
LID - e004419 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/jitc-2021-004419 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Immune checkpoint inhibitor-based combinations have expanded the
      treatment options for patients with renal cell carcinoma (RCC); however,
      tolerability remains challenging. The aim of this study was to evaluate the
      safety and efficacy of the immunostimulatory interleukin-2 cytokine prodrug
      bempegaldesleukin (BEMPEG) plus nivolumab (NIVO) as first-line therapy in
      patients with advanced clear-cell RCC. METHODS: This was an open-label
      multicohort, multicenter, single-arm phase 1/2 study; here, we report results
      from the phase 1/2 first-line RCC cohort (N=49). Patients received BEMPEG 0.006
      mg/kg plus NIVO 360 mg intravenously every 3 weeks. The primary objectives were
      safety and objective response rate (ORR; patients with measurable disease at
      baseline and at least one postbaseline tumor response assessment). Secondary
      objectives included overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS).
      Exploratory biomarker analyses: association between baseline biomarkers and ORR. 
      RESULTS: At a median follow-up of 32.7 months, the ORR was 34.7% (17/49
      patients); 3/49 patients (6.1%) had a complete response. Of the 17 patients with 
      response, 14 remained in response for >6 months, and 6 remained in response for
      >24 months. Median PFS was 7.7 months (95% CI 3.8 to 13.9), and median OS was not
      reached (95% CI 37.3 to not reached). Ninety-eight per cent (48/49) of patients
      experienced >/=1 treatment-related adverse event (TRAE) and 38.8% (19/49) had
      grade 3/4 TRAEs, most commonly syncope (8.2%; 4/49) and increased lipase (6.1%;
      3/49). No association between exploratory biomarkers and ORR was observed.
      Limitations include the small sample size and single-arm design. CONCLUSIONS:
      BEMPEG plus NIVO showed preliminary antitumor activity as first-line therapy in
      patients with advanced clear-cell RCC and was well tolerated. These findings
      warrant further investigation.

AB  - Fabry disease is an X-linked lysosomal storage disorder involving abnormal
      metabolism of glycosphingolipids, resulting in a range of multisystem organ
      dysfunction and ocular manifestations. Reports of laser-assisted in situ
      keratomileuses (LASIK) and photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) are lacking in this 
      patient population. Proceeding with corneal refractive surgery in patients with
      Fabry disease raises concerns regarding the pre-existing corneal manifestations, 
      reduced mesopic visual acuity, the potential for conjunctival lymphangiectasia,
      and predisposition to dry eye syndrome. This commentary discusses the current
      understanding of Fabry disease, including its ocular manifestations, and explores
      factors to consider when evaluating these patients for LASIK or PRK.

TI  - The use of ace inhibitors influences the risk of progression of BD-IPMNs under
      follow-up.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemoprevention's ability to slow down or prevent the progression of 
      BD-IPMNs is extremely appealing. Aspirin (ASA), Ace Inhibitors/Angiotensin
      Receptor Blockers (ACEIs/ARBs) and Statins (STATs) are frequently prescribed
      drugs with a possible beneficial effect on different cancer types. Their effect
      on IPMNs is largely unknown. AIM: To evaluate the association between the use of 
      ASA, ACEIs/ARBs and STATs and the risk of progression of BD-IPMNs in follow-up.
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: multicenter, retrospective cohort study on patients with
      presumed BD-IPMNs without relative or absolute indication for surgery.
      Pharmacological exposures and risk factors were collected. We identified
      clinically relevant progression (occurrence of radiological absolute or relative 
      indication for surgery) and any progression (occurrence of clinically relevant
      progression OR any dimension increase OR the occurrence of new cysts). RESULTS:
      Overall 594 patients were included. ACEIs were associated with a lower occurrence
      of any progression (HR = 0.70; 95% CI 0.49-0.98, p = 0.04) and clinically
      relevant progression, HR = 0.42 (95% CI 0.20-0.88; p = 0.02). No significant
      effect was shown for factors associated with the occurrence of pancreas cancer
      such as smoking, alcohol consumption and 1st degree family history of pancreas
      cancer. Among pharmacological exposures, no convincing effect was shown for the
      chronic use of ASA, ARB and STAT. CONCLUSIONS: ACEIs might have an effect in
      slowing the progression of BD-IPMNs. ASA, STAT and ARBs show no convincing effect
      on the progression of BD-IPMNs. Further, prospective, and long-term multicenter
      studies are needed to verify such association and to define the potential
      underlying mechanisms.

PG  - 4627-4642
LID - 10.3934/mbe.2022214 [doi]
AB  - We consider cancer cytotoxic drugs as an optimal control problem to stabilize a
      heterogeneous tumor by attacking not the most abundant cancer cells, but those
      that are crucial in the tumor ecosystem. We propose a mathematical cancer stem
      cell model that translates the hierarchy and heterogeneity of cancer cell types
      by including highly structured tumorigenic cancer stem cells that yield low
      differentiated cancer cells. With respect to the optimal control problem, under a
      certain admissibility hypothesis, the optimal controls of our problem are
      bang-bang controls. These control treatments can retain the entire tumor in the
      neighborhood of an equilibrium. We simulate the bang-bang control numerically and
      demonstrate that the optimal drug scheduling should be administered continuously 
      over long periods with short rest periods. Moreover, our simulations indicate
      that combining multidrug therapies and monotherapies is more efficient for
      heterogeneous tumors than using each one separately.

TI  - Addressing symptoms that affect patients' eating according to the Head and Neck
      Patient Symptom Checklist((c)).
PG  - 6163-6173

AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this prospective study was to assess which nutritional
      impact symptoms (NIS) interfere with oral intake in patients with head and neck
      cancer (HNC) and how the symptoms interfere with body weight loss, up to 1 year
      after treatment. METHODS: This was a prospective study of 197 patients with HNC
      planned for treatment with curative intention. Body weight was measured before
      the start of treatment, at 7 weeks after the start of treatment, and at 6 and 12 
      months after completion of treatment. NIS and NIS interfering with oral intake at
      each follow-up were examined with the Head and Neck Patient Symptom
      Checklist((c)) (HNSC((c))). RESULTS: At 7 weeks of follow-up, patients
      experienced the greatest symptom and interference burden, and 12 months after
      treatment the NIS scorings had not returned to baseline. One year after
      treatment, the highest scored NIS to interfere with oral intake was swallowing
      problems, chewing difficulties, and loss of appetite. At all 3 follow-ups, the
      total cumulative NIS and NIS interfering with oral intake were associated with
      body weight loss. Factors increasing the risk for a body weight loss of >/= 10%
      at 12 months after treatment were pain, loss of appetite, feeling full, sore
      mouth, difficulty swallowing, taste changes, and dry mouth. Women scored higher
      than men in NIS and NIS interfering with oral intake. Furthermore, during the
      study period about half of the population had a body weight loss > 5%.
      CONCLUSION: Because both nutritional and clinical factors may affect body weight,
      this study highlights the importance of a holistic approach when addressing the
      patients' nutritional issues. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov NCT03343236,

TI  - Plasma Endogenous Endotoxin Core Antibody Response to Exercise in Endurance
      Athletes.
LID - 10.1055/a-1827-3124 [doi]
AB  - The study aimed to investigate the impact of laboratory-controlled exertional and
      exertional-heat stress on concentrations of plasma endogenous endotoxin core
      antibody (EndoCAb). Forty-four (males n=26 and females n=18) endurance trained (V
      O 2max 56.8min/kg/min) participants completed either: P1-2h high intensity
      interval running in 23 degrees C ambient temperature (Tamb), P2-2h running at 60%
      V O2max in 35 degrees C Tamb, or P3-3h running at 60% V O2max in 23 degrees C
      Tamb. Blood samples were collected pre- and post-exercise to determine plasma
      IgM, IgA, and IgG concentrations. Overall resting pre-exercise levels for plasma 
      Ig were 173MMU/ml, 37AMU/ml, and 79GMU/ml, respectively. Plasma IgM concentration
      did not substantially change pre- to post-exercise in all protocols, and the
      magnitude of pre- to post-exercise change for IgM was not different between
      protocols (p=0.135). Plasma IgA and IgG increased pre- to post-exercise in P2
      only (p=0.017 and p=0.016, respectively), but remained within normative range
      (35-250MU/ml). P2 resulted in greater disturbances to plasma IgA (p=0.058) and
      IgG (p=0.037), compared with P1 and P3. No substantial differences in
      pre-exercise and exercise-associated change was observed for EndoCAb between
      biological sexes. Exertional and exertional-heat stress resulted in modest
      disturbances to systemic EndoCAb responses, suggesting EndoCAb biomarkers
      presents a low sensitivity response to controlled-laboratory experimental designs
      within exercise gastroenterology.

      and preferential position of individuals.
PG  - 38
LID - 10.1007/s00285-022-01738-y [doi]
AB  - We develop general heterogeneous nonlocal diffusion models and investigate their 
      connection to local diffusion models by taking a singular limit of focusing
      kernels. We reveal the link between the two groups of diffusion equations which
      include both spatial heterogeneity and anisotropy. In particular, we introduce
      the notion of deciding factors which single out a nonlocal diffusion model and
      typically consist of the total jump rate and the average jump length. In this
      framework, we also discuss the dependence of the profile of the steady state
      solutions on these deciding factors, thus shedding light on the preferential
      position of individuals.

TI  - Healthy narcissism and individuation - clinical, cultural and political
      manifestations.
PG  - 345-362
LID - 10.1111/1468-5922.12764 [doi]
AB  - This paper explores the healthy narcissism related to self-expression and looks
      at how this is frequently pathologized and split-off, with problematic
      consequences for the individual and for culture. This is explored through Yeats' 
      poem, 'The Second Coming', as are other personal, cultural and clinical
      manifestations, with a split evident between those who advocate self-denial and
      those who are 'full of passionate intensity' and seen as narcissistic. The paper 
      argues that the process of individuation requires us to embrace a multiplicity of
      self-states, and thus a broadening of ego-identifications, including states of
      vulnerability, self-denial, self-centredness, murderousness and power, in
      contrast to the unworkable unitary identifications of previous eras, where such
      states were projected onto scapegoat groups in, for example, racism. The
      neurobiological underpinnings of the core self are outlined which, the paper
      argues, help us better understand and accept the broad range of narcissistic
      phenomena. Embracing guilt, out of care and concern as described by Loewald
      (1979), and thus addressing states of both passive and active blindness to the
      other, allows us to put a 'human head on the lion's body', described in Yeats'
      poem. Some clinical manifestations and dynamics are also outlined.

TI  - The effect of transverse ocular magnification adjustment on macular thickness
      profile in different refractive errors in community-based adults.

AB  - PURPOSE: Changes in retinal thickness are common in various ocular diseases.
      Transverse magnification due to differing ocular biometrics, in particular axial 
      length, affects measurement of retinal thickness in different regions. This study
      evaluated the effect of axial length and refractive error on measured macular
      thickness in two community-based cohorts of healthy young adults. METHODS: A
      total of 2160 eyes of 1247 community-based participants (18-30 years; 23.4%
      myopes, mean axial length = 23.6mm) were included in this analysis. Macular
      thickness measurements were obtained using a spectral-domain optical coherence
      tomography (which assumes an axial length of 24.385mm). Using a custom program,
      retinal thickness data were extracted at the 9 Early Treatment of Diabetic
      Retinopathy Study (ETDRS) regions with and without correction for transverse
      magnificent effects, with the corrected measurements adjusting according to the
      participant's axial length. Linear mixed models were used to analyse the effect
      of correction and its interaction with axial length or refractive group on
      retinal thickness. RESULTS: The raw measures (uncorrected for axial length)
      underestimated the true retinal thickness at the central macula, while
      overestimating at most non-central macular regions. There was an axial length by 
      correction interaction effect in all but the nasal regions (all p<0.05). For each
      1mm increase in axial length, the central macular thickness is overestimated by
      2.7-2.9mum while thicknesses at other regions were underestimated by 0.2-4.1mum. 
      Based on the raw thickness measurements, myopes have thinner retinas than
      non-myopes at most non-central macular. However, this difference was no longer
      significant when the corrected data was used. CONCLUSION: In a community-based
      sample, the raw measurements underestimate the retinal thickness at the central
      macula and overestimate the retinal thickness at non-central regions of the ETDRS
      grid. The effect of axial length and refractive error on retinal thickness is
      reduced after correcting for transverse magnification effects resulting from
      axial length differences.

AB  - BACKGROUND: In response to the recommendations of the World Health Organization
      (WHO) World report on vision, the WHO is developing a Package of Eye Care
      Interventions (PECI) to support the integration of eye care into health systems
      within countries. This study was done to systematically review clinical practice 
      guidelines (CPGs) related to age-related macular degeneration (AMD) to provide
      evidence-based recommendations. METHODS: All AMD-related CPGs published between
      2010 and 2020 were reviewed and evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for
      Research and Evaluation II (AGREE II) tool. RESULTS: Of 3778 CPGs identified, 48 
      underwent full-text screening and eight underwent quality appraisal. Five
      National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE, UK) guidelines for AMD
      were finally selected for data extraction. Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial
      growth factor (VEGF) treatment was strongly recommended for advanced, active
      neovascular AMD based on high-quality evidence. Photodynamic therapy and laser
      photocoagulation were not recommended as an adjunct to anti-VEGF therapy as
      first-line treatment for AMD. Recommendations on other interventions, including
      epiretinal brachytherapy, miniature lens system implantation, and limited macular
      translocation, were weak and evidence mostly came from low-quality case series
      studies. Hence these interventions were recommended to be used only with special 
      arrangements or research. Existing evidence on treating geographic atrophy was
      limited, an implantable miniature telescope might be an effective intervention to
      improve vision but was still under investigation. DISCUSSION: Current CPGs
      recommend anti-VEGF therapy for patients with late active neovascular AMD, while 
      other interventions should be used with caution and further researches are
      warranted.

AB  - The quantification of vision impairments dates to the mid-nineteenth century with
      standardization of visual acuity and visual field measures in the eye clinic.
      Attempts to quantify the impact of vision impairments on patients' lives did not 
      receive clinical attention until the close of the twentieth century. Although
      formal psychometric theories and measurement instruments were well developed and 
      commonplace in educational testing, as well as in various areas in psychology and
      rehabilitation medicine, the late start applying them to clinical vision research
      created a vacuum that invited poorly developed and poorly functioning instruments
      and analytic methods. Although this research is still burdened with legacy
      instruments, mandates by regulatory agencies to include the patients'
      perspectives and preferences in the evaluation of clinical outcomes have
      stimulated the development and validation of self-report instruments grounded in 
      modern psychometric theory and methods. Here I review the progress and
      accomplishments of applying modern psychometrics to clinical vision research.
      Expected final online publication date for the Annual Review of Vision Science,
      Volume 8 is September 2022. Please see
      http://www.annualreviews.org/page/journal/pubdates for revised estimates.

      Massage: An Open-Label, Self-Controlled Crossover Trial.
PG  - 335-343
LID - 10.1089/whr.2021.0094 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Hot flashes, a symptom of menopause, can decrease women's quality of
      life. Sympathetic nervous system activation has been identified as an important
      factor in the occurrence of hot flashes. Given that somatosensory stimulation of 
      the oral cavity can affect autonomic nervous activity, we aimed to investigate
      the possibility that somatosensory stimulation of the gums (i.e., gum massage)
      could improve hot flashes. Materials and Methods: Nineteen women experiencing at 
      least one hot flash per day were instructed to perform a gum massage on
      themselves before undertaking mental workload, using arithmetic task, and the
      frequency of hot flashes experienced during this task was measured. Changes in
      autonomic nervous activity were assessed based on heart rate variability.
      Results: Massage conditions promoted a significantly lower arithmetic
      task-induced hot flash frequency compared with nonmassage conditions (p < 0.05). 
      During gum massage, the ratio between low and high frequency (LF/HF) values
      decreased significantly under massage conditions compared with nonmassage
      conditions (p < 0.01). During the arithmetic task, the gum massage-induced
      reduction in LF/HF, which changed from baseline, was significantly correlated
      with the gum massage-induced reduction in hot flash frequency. Conclusions: The
      results of this study indicate that gum massage can reduce the subjective
      frequency of hot flashes over a certain period under mental workload. Our study
      also indicates that gum massage can potentially decrease sympathetic nerve
      activity, which is known to be involved in the occurrence of hot flashes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To determine whether there is a difference in patient satisfaction
      between in-person and virtual voice therapy. METHODS: Patient satisfaction
      answers to the National Research Corporation (NRC) Health patient survey were
      retrieved for two separate 11 month periods. The first was for an in-person
      cohort, from April 2019 to February 2020. The second was for a virtual cohort
      between April 2020 and February 2021. Two group t tests or Wilcoxon rank sum
      tests were used to compare responses between the in-person and virtual cohorts.
      The effect of modality of therapy by gender, age, and race was examined by
      testing interactions with separate ANOVA models. RESULTS: Responses were compared
      between 224 patient satisfaction surveys for the virtual cohort and 309 patient
      satisfaction surveys for the in-person cohort. Overall, responses were highly
      favorable in all categories. There were no differences between the in-person and 
      virtual cohorts' responses with respect to three main categories: likelihood of
      future referral of clinic or provider; communication with provider; and
      comprehension of the treatment plan. The interaction between modality of therapy 
      delivery and age was significant for the question, "Did you know what to do after
      your visit," with 18-44 year olds in the in-person group reporting a better
      understanding of the treatment plan compared to the 18-44 year olds in the
      virtual therapy cohort (P = 0.004). There were no interactions between modality
      of therapy and gender, or race. CONCLUSION: Virtual delivery of voice therapy was
      associated with comparable visit satisfaction scores to in-person delivery, with 
      both delivery modalities demonstrating very high satisfaction. Future studies are
      needed to identify which patients and conditions are most suited for virtual
      versus in-person delivery of speech-language pathology services in voice clinics.

AB  - Endocrine disorders represent a large component of the so-called "chronic
      non-communicable diseases", which are responsible for the lion share of morbidity
      and mortality in contemporary societies. As discussed in this retrospective
      collection of articles, solid evidence from diabetes mellitus, the exemplar of
      common chronic endocrine disorders, highlights profound inequity in all aspects
      of endocrine disorders' management and outcomes that should be considered and
      addressed at large.

TI  - IGFBP-3 Regulates Mitochondrial Hyperfusion and Metabolic Activity in Ocular
      Surface Epithelia during Hyperosmolar Stress.
LID - 4066 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23074066 [doi]
AB  - In the eye, hyperosmolarity of the precorneal tear film triggers inflammation and
      the development of dry eye disease (DED), a highly prevalent condition that
      causes depression and disability in severe forms. A member of the insulin-like
      growth factor (IGF) family, the IGF binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3), is a pleiotropic
      protein with known roles in growth downregulation and survival. IGFBP-3 exerts
      these effects by blocking IGF-1 activation of the type 1 IGF-receptor (IGF-1R).
      Here, we examined a new IGF-independent role for IGFBP-3 in the regulation of
      mitochondrial and metabolic activity in ocular surface epithelial cells subject
      to hyperosmolar stress and in a mouse model of DED. We found that hyperosmolar
      stress decreased IGFBP-3 expression in vitro and in vivo. Treatment with
      exogenous IGFBP-3 induced an early, transient shift in IGF-1R to mitochondria,
      followed by IGFBP-3 nuclear accumulation. IGFBP-3 nuclear accumulation increased 
      protein translation, blocked the hyperosmolar-mediated decrease in oxidative
      phosphorylation through the induction of mitochondrial hyperfusion, and restored 
      corneal health in vivo. These data indicate that IGFBP-3 acts a stress response
      protein in ocular surface epithelia subject to hyperosmolar stress. These
      findings may lead to the development of first-in-class therapeutics to treat eye 
      diseases with underlying mitochondrial dysfunction.

TI  - Exfoliation Syndrome in Baja Verapaz Guatemala: A Cross-Sectional Study and
      Review of the Literature.
LID - 1795 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11071795 [doi]
AB  - There are little epidemiologic data on exfoliation syndrome (XFS) or exfoliation 
      glaucoma (XFG) in Guatemala, especially in the underserved Baja Verapaz region.
      This observational study assessing XFS/XFG and demographic factors of this region
      aims to better understand unique exogenous and endogenous risk factors associated
      with XFS/XFG in Guatemala. During Moran Eye Center's global outreach medical eye 
      camps from 2016-2017, 181 patients age 15 years and older presented for complete 
      eye exams. These individuals were screened for eye disease and evaluated for
      possible surgical interventions that could occur during the camps to improve
      eyesight. During the dilated exams, XFS was noted as missing or present. Of those
      181, 10 had insufficient data and 18 lacked a definitive diagnosis of XFS or XFG,
      resulting in 153 evaluable patients; 46 XFS and 9 XFG were identified. Age,
      gender, hometown, ancestry (languages spoken by parents and grandparents), past
      medical history, family medical history, and occupational data (only 2017 trip)
      were obtained for each patient. The most common occupations of these individuals 
      were farming and housekeeping. Higher rates of XFS/XFG were noted in individuals 
      of rural compared to urban settings and Mayan speaking people compared with
      Spanish speakers. Based on this subset of patients, with various ocular
      pathologies being evaluated during medical eye outreach camps, the prevalence of 
      XFS/XFG appeared to be 36%, a high prevalence compared to other world
      populations. Location and higher altitude, along with a farming occupation, may
      contribute to XFS development and subsequent progression to XFG. To our
      knowledge, this is the largest study looking at the epidemiology of XFS/XFG in
      the Baja Verapaz region of Guatemala for those over the age of 15 years seeking
      eye exams and interventions.

TI  - Pentafecta for Radical Nephroureterectomy in Patients with High-Risk Upper Tract 
      Urothelial Carcinoma: A Proposal for Standardization of Quality Care Metrics.
LID - 1781 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cancers14071781 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Measuring quality of care indicators is important for clinicians and 
      decision making in health care to improve patient outcomes. OBJECTIVE: The
      primary objective was to identify quality of care indicators for patients with
      upper tract urothelial carcinoma (UTUC) and to validate these in an international
      cohort treated with radical nephroureterectomy (RNU). The secondary objective was
      to assess the factors associated with failure to validate the pentafecta. DESIGN:
      We performed a retrospective multicenter study of patients treated with RNU for
      EAU high-risk (HR) UTUC. OUTCOME MEASUREMENTS AND STATISTICAL ANALYSIS: Five
      quality indicators were consensually approved, including a negative surgical
      margin, a complete bladder-cuff resection, the absence of hematological
      complications, the absence of major complications, and the absence of a 12-month 
      postoperative recurrence. After multiple imputations and propensity-score
      matching, log-rank tests and a Cox regression were used to assess the survival
      outcomes. Logistic regression analyses assessed predictors for pentafecta
      failure. RESULTS: Among the 1718 included patients, 844 (49%) achieved the
      pentafecta. The median follow-up was 31 months. Patients who achieved the
      pentafecta had superior 5-year overall- (OS) and cancer-specific survival (CSS)
      compared to those who did not (68.7 vs. 50.1% and 79.8 vs. 62.7%, respectively,
      all p &lt; 0.001). On multivariable analyses, achieving the pentafecta was
      associated with improved recurrence-free survival (RFS), CSS, and OS. No
      preoperative clinical factors predicted a failure to validate the pentafecta.
      CONCLUSIONS: Establishing quality indicators for UTUC may help define prognosis
      and improve patient care. We propose a pentafecta quality criteria in RNU
      patients. Approximately half of the patients evaluated herein reached this
      endpoint, which in turn was independently associated with survival outcomes.
      Extended validation is needed.

TI  - Omega-3/Omega-6 Long-Chain Fatty Acid Imbalance in Phase I Retinopathy of
      Prematurity.
LID - 1333 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu14071333 [doi]
AB  - There is a gap in understanding the effect of the essential omega-3 and omega-6
      long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acids (LCPUFA) on Phase I retinopathy of
      prematurity (ROP), which precipitates proliferative ROP. Postnatal hyperglycemia 
      contributes to Phase I ROP by delaying retinal vascularization. In mouse neonates
      with hyperglycemia-associated Phase I retinopathy, dietary omega-3 (vs. omega-6
      LCPUFA) supplementation promoted retinal vessel development. However, omega-6
      (vs. omega-3 LCPUFA) was also developmentally essential, promoting neuronal
      growth and metabolism as suggested by a strong metabolic shift in almost all
      types of retinal neuronal and glial cells identified with single-cell
      transcriptomics. Loss of adiponectin (APN) in mice (mimicking the low APN levels 
      in Phase I ROP) decreased LCPUFA levels (including omega-3 and omega-6) in
      retinas under normoglycemic and hyperglycemic conditions. omega-3 (vs. omega-6)
      LCPUFA activated the APN pathway by increasing the circulating APN levels and
      inducing expression of the retinal APN receptor. Our findings suggested that both
      omega-3 and omega-6 LCPUFA are crucial in protecting against retinal
      neurovascular dysfunction in a Phase I ROP model; adequate omega-6 LCPUFA levels 
      must be maintained in addition to omega-3 supplementation to prevent retinopathy.
      Activation of the APN pathway may further enhance the omega-3 and omega-6
      LCPUFA's protection against ROP.

TI  - Detailed analysis of antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination and infection
      in macaques.
PG  - e1010155
LID - 10.1371/journal.ppat.1010155 [doi]
AB  - Macaques are a commonly used model for studying immunity to human viruses,
      including for studies of SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. However, it is
      unknown whether macaque antibody responses resemble the response in humans. To
      answer this question, we employed a phage-based deep mutational scanning approach
      (Phage-DMS) to compare which linear epitopes are targeted on the SARS-CoV-2 Spike
      protein in convalescent humans, convalescent (re-infected) rhesus macaques,
      mRNA-vaccinated humans, and repRNA-vaccinated pigtail macaques. We also used
      Phage-DMS to determine antibody escape pathways within each epitope, enabling a
      granular comparison of antibody binding specificities at the locus level.
      Overall, we identified some common epitope targets in both macaques and humans,
      including in the fusion peptide (FP) and stem helix-heptad repeat 2 (SH-H)
      regions. Differences between groups included a response to epitopes in the
      N-terminal domain (NTD) and C-terminal domain (CTD) in vaccinated humans but not 
      vaccinated macaques, as well as recognition of a CTD epitope and epitopes
      flanking the FP in convalescent macaques but not convalescent humans. There was
      also considerable variability in the escape pathways among individuals within
      each group. Sera from convalescent macaques showed the least variability in
      escape overall and converged on a common response with vaccinated humans in the
      SH-H epitope region, suggesting highly similar antibodies were elicited.
      Collectively, these findings suggest that the antibody response to SARS-CoV-2 in 
      macaques shares many features with humans, but with substantial differences in
      the recognition of certain epitopes and considerable individual variability in
      antibody escape profiles, suggesting a diverse repertoire of antibodies that can 
      respond to major epitopes in both humans and macaques. Differences in macaque
      species and exposure type may also contribute to these findings.

TI  - Suitable Electrode Choice for Robotic-Assisted Cochlear Implant Surgery: A
      Systematic Literature Review of Manual Electrode Insertion Adverse Events.
PG  - 823219
LID - 10.3389/fsurg.2022.823219 [doi]
AB  - Background and Objective: The cochlear implant (CI) electrode insertion process
      is a key step in CI surgery. One of the aims of advances in robotic-assisted CI
      surgery (RACIS) is to realize better cochlear structure preservation and to
      precisely control insertion. The aim of this literature review is to gain insight
      into electrode selection for RACIS by acquiring a thorough knowledge of electrode
      insertion and related complications from classic CI surgery involving a manual
      electrode insertion process. Methods: A systematic electronic search of the
      literature was carried out using PubMed, Scopus, Cochrane, and Web of Science to 
      find relevant literature on electrode tip fold over (ETFO), electrode scalar
      deviation (ESD), and electrode migration (EM) from both pre-shaped and straight
      electrode types. Results: A total of 82 studies that include 8,603 ears implanted
      with a CI, i.e., pre-shaped (4,869) and straight electrodes (3,734), were
      evaluated. The rate of ETFO (25 studies, 2,335 ears), ESD (39 studies, 3,073
      ears), and EM (18 studies, 3,195 ears) was determined. An incidence rate (+/-95% 
      CI) of 5.38% (4.4-6.6%) of ETFO, 28.6% (26.6-30.6%) of ESD, and 0.53% (0.2-1.1%) 
      of EM is associated with pre-shaped electrodes, whereas with straight electrodes 
      it was 0.51% (0.1-1.3%), 11% (9.2-13.0%), and 3.2% (2.5-3.95%), respectively. The
      differences between the pre-shaped and straight electrode types are highly
      significant (p < 0.001). Laboratory experiments show evidence that robotic
      insertions of electrodes are less traumatic than manual insertions. The influence
      of round window (RW) vs. cochleostomy (Coch) was not assessed. Conclusion:
      Considering the current electrode designs available and the reported incidence of
      insertion complications, the use of straight electrodes in RACIS and conventional
      CI surgery (and manual insertion) appears to be less traumatic to intracochlear
      structures compared with pre-shaped electrodes. However, EM of straight
      electrodes should be anticipated. RACIS has the potential to reduce these
      complications.

AB  - In the community, there is a need to more objectively evaluate the response of
      common chronic psychiatric disorders to treatment. Brain single photon emission
      computed tomography (SPECT) indirectly measures cerebral functional activity by
      uptake of a radiotracer, which follows regional cerebral blood flow. Brain 3D
      Thresholded SPECT scans are thresholded three dimensional images derived from
      brain SPECT data. A retrospective community study of longitudinal (before and
      after treatment) brain 3D Thresholded SPECT scans of 73 patients with all-cause
      psychiatric disorders (most frequent diagnostic clusters: attention-deficit
      hyperactivity disorder, post-mild traumatic brain injury, affective disorders,
      psychotic disorders, post-viral chronic syndromes), shows these baseline SPECT
      scans predict improvement (non-worsening to large improvement) in clinical
      functioning with a sensitivity of 94% (95% confidence interval 86-98%) and a
      specificity of 67% (95% confidence interval 21-94%). In contrast, contemporaneous
      analysis by the same radiologist of conventional 2D reading of the same before
      and after treatment brain SPECT scan data of the same 73 patients, predicted
      improvement (non-worsening to large improvement) in clinical functioning with a
      sensitivity of only 26% (95% confidence interval 17-37%) although with a
      specificity of 100% (95% confidence interval 44-100%). These data suggest 3D
      Thresholded SPECT scans can provide the clinician with a more objective measure
      for verifying improvement in psychiatric disorders seen in the community,
      consistent with prior studies of SPECT as a measure of neurobiological change.
      Furthermore, these data suggest 3D Thresholded SPECT scans may have clinical
      application in guiding treatment and potentially improving outcomes.

TI  - The genus Trichinella and its presence in wildlife worldwide: A review.
LID - 10.1111/tbed.14554 [doi]
AB  - The genus Trichinella has a worldwide distribution, infecting people, domestic
      animals, and wildlife. It includes 13 genotypes, which are geographically
      delimited; Trichinella is transmitted to people through the ingestion of
      undercooked meat. Historically, it has been associated with pigs, but most
      Trichinella species affect wildlife, and cases of trichinellosis due to the
      consumption of game meat have been emerging. Therefore, it is important to
      monitor the sources of transmission to domestic animals and humans. The objective
      of this work was to analyse reports of Trichinella spp. in wild/feral animals
      around the world to identify the needs of future research in the epidemiology of 
      the sylvatic cycle. A search of studies published until 2021 was conducted using 
      Web of Science and SciELO. In the Palearctic, the most commonly studied hosts
      were wild boars and red foxes, and hosts with the highest prevalence rates were
      polar bears and martens. In the Nearctic, red foxes and black bears were the most
      frequently studied hosts, and the highest prevalence was found for wolverines and
      brown bears. In the Neotropics, positive reports were only identified in two
      countries, with wild boars being the most commonly studied species, and
      armadillos featuring the highest prevalence. In the Afrotropics, Trichinella
      limits its presence to Sub-Saharan Africa, where lions are the most studied
      hosts, and spotted hyenas have the highest prevalence. In the Indo-Malaya and
      Australasia ecozones, information on wildlife is scarce; the Norwegian rat is the
      most frequently studied host, and the Tasmanian devil has the highest prevalence 
      of infection. In the last decade, research on world wildlife has increased which 
      is associated with more frequent trichinellosis outbreaks caused by the
      consumption of wild meat. The results suggest the need to increase research in
      developing countries, particularly where more diverse sources of meat are
      available for human consumption.

PG  - 1515-1525
LID - 10.1111/apa.16354 [doi]
AB  - AIM: To describe survival and neonatal morbidities in infants born before 24
      weeks of gestation during a 12-year period. METHODS: Data were retrieved from
      national registries and validated in medical files of infants born before 24
      weeks of gestation 2007-2018 in Sweden. Temporal changes were evaluated. RESULTS:
      In 2007-2018, 282 live births were recorded at 22 weeks and 460 at 23 weeks of
      gestation. Survival to discharge from hospital of infants born alive at 22 and 23
      weeks increased from 20% to 38% (p = 0.006) and from 45% to 67% (p < 0.001)
      respectively. Caesarean section increased from 12% to 22% (p = 0.038) for infants
      born at 22 weeks. Neonatal morbidity rates in infants alive at 40 weeks of
      postmenstrual age (n = 399) were unchanged except for an increase in necrotising 
      enterocolitis from 0 to 33% (p = 0.017) in infants born at 22 weeks of gestation.
      Bronchopulmonary dysplasia was more common in boys than girls, 90% versus 82% (p 
      = 0.044). The number of infants surviving to 40 weeks doubled over time.
      CONCLUSION: Increased survival of infants born before 24 weeks of gestation
      resulted in increasing numbers of very immature infants with severe neonatal
      morbidities likely to have a negative impact on long-term outcome.

TI  - Are there differences in arthroscopic and histological features between traumatic
      and degenerative rotator cuff tears in elderly patients? A prospective
      dual-center analysis.
PG  - 206
LID - 10.1186/s13018-022-03100-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Discriminating traumatic rotator cuff tears (RCTs) from degenerative 
      RCTs is sometimes difficult in elderly patients because the prevalence of
      asymptomatic RCTs increases with age. Little intraoperative information is
      available on the characteristics of traumatic and degenerative RCTs in elderly
      patients. The purpose of this study was to compare the arthroscopic findings and 
      histological changes of the coracoacromial ligament (CAL) between traumatic and
      degenerative RCTs in elderly patients. METHODS: Forty-two shoulders of 42
      patients aged >/= 65 years underwent arthroscopic rotator cuff repair. Nineteen
      patients had traumatic full-thickness RCTs (Group T), and 23 had degenerative
      full-thickness RCTs (Group D). The quality of the rotator cuff tissue and the
      condition of the long head of the biceps were examined. The grade of CAL was
      evaluated both arthroscopically and histologically. The stiffness of the
      musculotendinous unit was calculated by measuring the force and displacement
      using a tensiometer. The arthroscopic and histological findings of the two groups
      were compared. RESULTS: Although the mean tendon displacement was comparable, the
      stiffness was different between Group T and Group D (0.56 +/- 0.31 and 1.09 +/-
      0.67 N/mm, respectively; p < 0.001). Both arthroscopic and histological analysis 
      of the CAL showed that the degenerative changes in the CAL were milder in Group T
      than in Group D (p < 0.001 and p < 0.001, respectively). There was a moderate
      positive correlation between the arthroscopic findings of CAL degeneration and
      the histopathological changes in this ligament (r = 0.47, p = 0.002).
      CONCLUSIONS: Traumatic RCTs were characterized by preserved elasticity of the
      musculotendinous unit and milder CAL degeneration compared with degenerative RCTs
      even in elderly patients.

AB  - Telemedicine has traditionally been applied within remote settings to overcome
      geographical barriers to healthcare access, providing an alternate means of
      connecting patients to specialist services. The coronavirus 2019 pandemic has
      rapidly expanded the use of telemedicine into metropolitan areas and enhanced
      global telemedicine capabilities. Through our experience of delivering real-time 
      telemedicine over the past decade within a large outreach eye service, we have
      identified key themes for successful implementation which may be relevant to
      services facing common challenges. We present our journey toward establishing a
      comprehensive teleophthalmology model built on the principles of collaborative
      care, with a focus on delivering practical lessons for service design. Artificial
      intelligence is an emerging technology that has shown potential to further
      address resource limitations. We explore the applications of artificial
      intelligence and the need for targeted research within underserved settings in
      order to meet growing healthcare demands. Based on our rural telemedicine
      experience, we make the case that similar models may be adapted to urban settings
      with the aim of reducing surgical waitlists and improving efficiency.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the binocular vision status in normally-sighted school aged
      children who used digital devices. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted
      at B.P. Koirala Lions Center for Ophthalmic Studies, Kathmandu, Nepal for a
      duration of one year. One hundred and eighty school aged children (71 female and 
      109 male) aged 7 to 17 years were included in the study. All the children
      underwent detailed ophthalmic and binocular vision examinations. The duration of 
      the use of digital devices by the children were asked to either the parents or
      guardians present at the time of the study. The study participants were divided
      into two groups: children who used digital devices for the last six months (users
      group) and those who hadn't used digital devices for the last six months (non
      users group). The users group was again divided into two subgroups: children who 
      used digital devices for less than 3 hours per day and a day per week (low
      digital device users subgroup) and children who used digital devices for more
      than 3 hours per day and all days in a week (high digital device users subgroup).
      RESULTS: Accommodative amplitudes, accommodative facility, and positive fusional 
      vergence for both near and distance were significantly reduced in the high
      digital device users group than in the low digital device users subgroup (p
      <0.01). Stereo acuity, near point of convergence, and negative fusional vergences
      for both near and distance were not statistically significantly different between
      the two subgroups. Prevalence of accommodative and vergence anomalies (except
      convergence insufficiency) was more in the high digital device users subgroup
      than in the low digital device users subgroup (p<0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Children who
      used digital devices for a significantly greater amount of time had significantly
      reduced amplitudes of accommodation, accommodative facility, and positive
      fusional vergence both at near and distance.

TI  - Fire, grazers, and browsers interact with grass competition to determine tree
      establishment in an African savanna.
PG  - e3715
LID - 10.1002/ecy.3715 [doi]
AB  - In savanna ecosystems, fire and herbivory alter the competitive relationship
      between trees and grasses. Mechanistically, grazing herbivores favor trees by
      removing grass, which reduces tree-grass competition and limits fire. Conversely,
      browsing herbivores consume trees and limit their recovery from fire. Herbivore
      feeding decisions are in turn shaped by risk-resource trade-offs that potentially
      determine the spatial patterns of herbivory. Identifying the dominant mechanistic
      pathways by which fire and herbivores control tree cover remains challenging, but
      is essential for understanding savanna dynamics. We used an experiment in the
      Serengeti ecosystem and a simple simulation driven by experimental results to
      address two main aims: (1) determine the importance of direct and indirect
      effects of grass, fire, and herbivory on seedling establishment and (2) establish
      whether predators determine the spatial pattern of successful seedling
      establishment via effects on mesoherbivore distribution. We transplanted tree
      seedlings into plots with a factorial combination of grass and herbivores
      (present/absent) across a lion-kill-risk gradient in the Serengeti, burning half 
      of the plots near the end of the experiment. Ungrazed grass limited tree seedling
      survival directly via competition, indirectly via fire, and by slowing seedling
      growth, which drove higher seedling mortality during fires. These effects
      restricted seedling establishment to below 18% and, in conjunction with browsing,
      resulted in seedling establishment dropping below 5%. In the absence of browsing 
      and fire, grazing drove a 7.5-fold increase in seedling establishment. Lion
      predation risk had no observable impact on herbivore effects on seedling
      establishment. The severe negative effects of grass on seedling mortality
      suggests that regional patterns of tree cover and fire may overestimate the role 
      of fire in limiting tree cover, with regular fires representing a proxy for the
      competitive effects of grass.

PG  - 660-665
LID - 10.1292/jvms.21-0261 [doi]
AB  - Irregular triangular cartilage or bone fragments are sometimes found in the
      fibrous triangle of the heart. Ossa cordis and/or cartilago cordis has been
      demonstrated in various terrestrial animal species. Regarding marine mammals,
      sperm whales lack heart bones, and there have been no studies on bones or
      cartilage in pinniped hearts. Therefore, we examined the ossa cordis and/or
      cartilago cordis of the Steller sea lion. Eleven Steller sea lion hearts were
      examined morphologically and histologically. Before dissection, some hearts were 
      imaged by CT to confirm the presence of ossa cordis or cartilago cordis. As a
      result, ossa cordis-like fragments were confirmed in four adults and one pup. All
      of the fragments were found at the right fiber triangle, and one adult had
      ossified tissue, including adipose tissue in the bone marrow cavity. The ossa
      cordis probably support the aorta because they surround the aorta as in other
      terrestrial animals. Steller sea lions can dive to a few hundred meters, but they
      need to rest on land frequently. Hence, their ossa cordis help maintain heart
      function during the tachycardia that occurs upon repeated surfacing and movements
      on land after diving in water.

      response to bevacizumab: a short-term study.
PG  - 25158414221074519
LID - 10.1177/25158414221074519 [doi]
AB  - Background: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the short-term response of 
      intravitreal bevacizumab in diabetic macular edema (DME) and assess the variation
      in treatment outcomes in different morphology patterns using spectral
      domain-optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT). Objective: To study different
      morphological patterns of DME based on OCT and compare their treatment response
      to bevacizumab. Methods: Hundred and twelve eyes of 112 patients with DME were
      included and treated with intravitreal bevacizumab (1.25 mg/0.05 ml monthly for 3
      months). The morphological patterns of DME were classified on the basis of OCT
      into three groups - diffuse retinal thickening (DRT), cystoid macular edema
      (CME), and serous retinal detachment (SRD) - and changes in central macular
      thickness (CMT) and best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) after treatment were
      compared. Results: A total of 112 eyes with DME were included and consisted of 40
      DRT, 37 CME, and 35 SRD. Treatment with bevacizumab resulted in decrease in
      central macular thickness and improvement in BCVA in all three groups. The
      baseline visual acuity and CMT of DRT group was better than that of the other two
      groups. The treatment outcome was measured in terms of CMT and BCVA. Change in
      CMT was statistically significant among three groups and was found to be better
      in DRT group (p < 0.05, 95% confidence interval). However, there was
      statistically no significant variation between the three groups regarding the
      change in BCVA (p = 0.169, 95% confidence interval). Conclusion: Anatomic and
      visual improvement can be achieved by bevacizumab in all patterns of DME.
      However, individual pattern may respond differently. DRT, which appears to be the
      earliest form of DME, responds better than other types. Thus, the pattern of
      macular edema shown by OCT may provide an objective guideline in predicting the
      response of bevacizumab injection in DME.

TI  - The Wounded Lion - Ageism and Masculinity in the Israeli Film Industry.
PG  - 756472

AB  - One of the intriguing issues connected to power relations in the world of cinema 
      that has yet to be adequately explored is what has happened over the years
      concerning the dominance and privilege of masculinity as signifying preferred
      social status. This qualitative study explores this subject based on transcribed 
      semi-structured interviews with 13 award-winning Israeli directors over the age
      of 55. The research examines two questions: How has the film industry changed its
      relation to leading, award-winning film directors as they grow older? And, what
      challenges confront the directors, in terms of their own self-perceptions? These 
      questions capture the collisional intersection between hegemonic masculinity and 
      ageism, because they examine the loss of power attributed to men in the film
      industry as they reach the second half of their lives. The findings led to the
      formation of a theoretical model of ageism within the cinematic industry,
      allowing for the dismantling of the different factors that create obstacles for
      directors as they get older. The four layers of the model are: arbitrary ageism, 
      manifested in the demands of a rapidly changing industry in a changing world;
      passive ageism, expressed through encounters with negative attitudes; active
      ageism, reflected in preventing older directors from receiving funding and from
      screening their films; and self-ageism, manifested in the directors' attitudes
      toward themselves.

TI  - Revealing environmental synchronicity that enhances anchovy recruitment in the
      Mediterranean Sea.
PG  - 5600

AB  - Small pelagic fishes in the Mediterranean Sea constitute about half of the total 
      landings, of which almost one-third is European anchovy. Anchovy abundance mainly
      depends on early life stage and juvenile survival and growth, which are
      susceptible to shifts in environmental processes. Due to the commercial
      importance of this species, it is necessary to elucidate the processes affecting 
      recruitment strength for effective fishery management, using environmental
      indices to set more appropriate harvesting limits. Here, we constructed a simple 
      index to capture synchronicity between enrichment and retention/concentration
      processes, which are known to affect anchovy abundance, during the first year of 
      life. Three ecosystems in the Mediterranean were examined: Gulf of Lions,
      Adriatic Sea, and Strait of Sicily. The synchronicity index (SI) represented the 
      synergic evolution over time of the chlorophyll-a concentration (CHL, enrichment 
      process) and mixed layer depth (MLD, concentration/retention processes), and was 
      related with the abundance of anchovy recruits obtained from published survey
      reports. Considering different ecosystems, when the SI was significantly higher, 
      anchovy recruitment was promoted. This result indicated SI is consistent across
      ecosystems in explaining anchovy abundance fluctuations and thus could be used to
      enhance fisheries management and extended to assess the impact of projected
      environmental changes.

AB  - Introduction: there is few data on epidemiology or clinico-pathology of primary
      bone tumours in Ethiopia. Bone tumors often have a similar presentation and
      clinical approach, but they present individual characteristics that are important
      for treatment and prognosis. This study aimed to provide a brief overview of
      histopathological pattern of primary bone tumours and the distribution of
      specific diagnosis by age, sex and anatomic locations. Methods: a retrospective
      descriptive cross-sectional study was conducted from January 2015 to October 2019
      in the Department of Pathology, College of Health Sciences, Addis Ababa
      University based on surgical biopsy results. Results: there were 335 patients;
      158 (47%) had benign tumours and 177 (53%) had malignant tumours. Osteochondroma 
      was the most common benign bone tumour with 32.3% followed by giant cell tumour
      16.5%, chondroma 11% and others 40.2%. Osteosarcoma constitutes 62% of all
      primary malignant bone neoplasms, followed by ewing sarcoma 15.2%, chondrosarcoma
      11.3%, and others 11.5%. Most age group affected by primary bone tumours were
      10-29 yrs and most common locations of presentation for primary malignant bone
      tumours were distal femur and proximal tibia. Conclusion: the present study
      results parallel the findings previously reported in literature and show a
      similar distribution of primary bone tumors as in the other developed and
      underdeveloped countries.

      recognition.
PG  - 5494

AB  - Human Action Recognition (HAR) is a popular area of research in computer vision
      due to its wide range of applications such as surveillance, health care, and
      gaming, etc. Action recognition based on 3D skeleton data allows simplistic,
      cost-efficient models to be formed making it a widely used method. In this work, 
      we propose DSwarm-Net, a framework that employs deep learning and swarm
      intelligence-based metaheuristic for HAR that uses 3D skeleton data for action
      classification. We extract four different types of features from the skeletal
      data namely: Distance, Distance Velocity, Angle, and Angle Velocity, which
      capture complementary information from the skeleton joints for encoding them into
      images. Encoding the skeleton data features into images is an alternative to the 
      traditional video-processing approach and it helps in making the classification
      task less complex. The Distance and Distance Velocity encoded images have been
      stacked depth-wise and fed into a Convolutional Neural Network model which is a
      modified version of Inception-ResNet. Similarly, the Angle and Angle Velocity
      encoded images have been stacked depth-wise and fed into the same network. After 
      training these models, deep features have been extracted from the pre-final layer
      of the networks, and the obtained feature representation is optimized by a
      nature-inspired metaheuristic, called Ant Lion Optimizer, to eliminate the
      non-informative or misleading features and to reduce the dimensionality of the
      feature set. DSwarm-Net has been evaluated on three publicly available HAR

TI  - African wild dog movements show contrasting responses to long and short term risk
      of encountering lions: analysis using dynamic Brownian bridge movement models.
PG  - 16
LID - 10.1186/s40462-022-00316-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prey depletion is a threat to the world's large carnivores, and is
      likely to affect subordinate competitors within the large carnivore guild
      disproportionately. African lions limit African wild dog populations through
      interference competition and intraguild predation. When lion density is reduced
      as a result of prey depletion, wild dogs are not competitively released, and
      their population density remains low. Research examining distributions has
      demonstrated spatial avoidance of lions by wild dogs, but the effects of lions on
      patterns of movement have not been tested. Movement is one of the most
      energetically costly activities for many species and is particularly costly for
      cursorial hunters like wild dogs. Therefore, testing how top-down, bottom-up, and
      anthropogenic variables affect movement patterns can provide insight into
      mechanisms that limit wild dogs (and other subordinate competitors) in
      resource-depleted ecosystems. METHODS: We measured movement rates using the
      motion variance from dynamic Brownian Bridge Movement Models (dBBMMs) fit to data
      from GPS-collared wild dogs, then used a generalized linear model to test for
      effects on movement of predation risk from lions, predictors of prey density, and
      anthropogenic and seasonal variables. RESULTS: Wild dogs proactively reduced
      movement in areas with high lion density, but reactively increased movement when 
      lions were immediately nearby. Predictors of prey density had consistently weaker
      effects on movement than lions did, but movements were reduced in the wet season 
      and when dependent offspring were present. CONCLUSION: Wild dogs alter their
      patterns of movement in response to lions in ways that are likely to have
      important energetic consequences. Our results support the recent suggestion that 
      competitive limitation of wild dogs by lions remains strong in ecosystems where
      lion and wild dog densities are both low as a result of anthropogenic prey
      depletion. Our results reinforce an emerging pattern that movements often show
      contrasting responses to long-term and short-term variation in predation risk.

TI  - Effects of reduced mobility on trabecular bone density in captive big cats.
PG  - 211345
LID - 10.1098/rsos.211345 [doi]
AB  - Bone responds to elevated mechanical loading by increasing in mass and density.
      Therefore, wild animals should exhibit greater skeletal mass and density than
      captive conspecifics. This expectation is pertinent to testing bone functional
      adaptation theories and to comparative studies, which commonly use skeletal
      remains that combine zoo and wild-caught specimens. Conservationists are also
      interested in the effects of captivity on bone morphology as it may influence
      rewilding success. We compared trabecular bone volume fraction (BVF) between wild
      and captive mountain lions, cheetahs, leopards and jaguars. We found
      significantly greater BVF in wild than in captive felids. Effects of captivity
      were more marked in the humerus than in the femur. A ratio of humeral/femoral BVF
      was also lower in captive animals and showed a positive relationship to home
      range size in wild animals. Results are consistent with greater forelimb than
      hindlimb loading during terrestrial travel, and possibly reduced loading of the
      forelimb associated with lack of predatory behaviour in captive animals. Thus,
      captivity among felids has general effects on BVF in the postcranial skeleton and
      location-specific effects related to limb use. Caution should be exercised when
      identifying skeletal specimens for use in comparative studies and when rearing
      animals for conservation purposes.

      interpretive synthesis review.
PG  - 1-8
LID - 10.1080/10400435.2022.2060375 [doi]
AB  - This review sought to critically evaluate the use of the teleoperated humanoid
      robotic communications device, Telenoid, for therapeutic purposes with older
      adults, and identify and highlight key considerations for future research and
      clinical practice within gerontechnology. A critical interpretive synthesis was
      conducted, with nine electronic databases and online sources searched using the
      keyword "Telenoid." Studies were included in the review if they were: written in 
      English; reported primary research; employed a qualitative, quantitative, or
      mixed-method design; and described or measured effects, experiences, or
      perceptions of using Telenoid for therapeutic purposes with older adults.
      Critical engagement with the studies identified key themes, as well as
      opportunities to advance future research. Ten studies involving Telenoid were
      identified, with eight focused on older adults living with dementia. Study
      findings centered around two themes: effects (including positive effects and
      negative reactions), and challenges and considerations (including technical
      issues, operator training, acceptability, and dosage). Although several issues
      currently challenge the use of Telenoid, available studies show some therapeutic 
      potential of using Telenoid with older adults, including those living with
      dementia, particularly for communication and mood. Higher-quality studies are
      required to advance understanding, and considerations for the field are outlined 
      to aid development.

TI  - A systematic review of clinical practice guidelines for myopic macular
      degeneration.
PG  - 04026
LID - 10.7189/jogh.12.04026 [doi]
AB  - Background: Myopic macular degeneration (MMD) is a primary cause of blindness and
      visual impairment in many parts of the world. A review of clinical practice
      guidelines (CPGs) for intervention selection are required with the increasing
      demand for MMD management in clinical practice as well as in national health
      services. Therefore, we aim to systematically review CPGs for MMD and assist the 
      recommendations development of the Package of Eye Care Interventions (PECI)
      program of the World Health Organization. Methods: A systematic review of CPGs
      published on MMD between 2010 and April 2020 was conducted. Guidelines were
      evaluated using the Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation II (AGREE
      II) tool. Cochrane systematic reviews were also included when the evidence from
      included CPGs were inadequate or contradict. Results: After applying exclusion
      criteria and conducting the quality appraisal, two CPGs were finally included.
      The average of the AGREE II ratings for the identified Guidelines were 56 and 63 
      respectively (7 for each item). To provide further information on interventions
      for MMD, one Cochrane review on MMD was additionally identified and included in
      the study. Intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs
      were recommended for patients with myopic choroidal neovascularization (mCNV) as 
      first-line therapy to improve vision and reduce central macular thickness, and
      ranibizumab showed significant effectiveness compared to photodynamic therapy
      (PDT). PDT was recommended to be performed in those resistant to the treatment by
      one CPG but lacked of adequate description and support. Data extracted from the
      Cochrane systematic reviews indicated that anti-VEGF therapy for mCNV had
      significant effectiveness in improving visual acuity and reducing CMT compared to
      PDT with moderate to low certainty of evidence. Ranibizumab and bevacizumab were 
      considered as equally effective with moderate certainty. Conclusions: The
      outcomes of this review suggest that high quality clinical practice guidelines
      for MMD management are limited. Intravitreal injection of anti-VEGF agents was
      recommended as an effective intervention to treat myopic CNV as the first-line
      treatment, while there was inadequate guidance for the application of PDT in
      myopic CNV management. The use of other interventions for MMD were not
      recommended at this time and additional evidence is called for.

TI  - Intravitreal dexamethasone versus bevacizumab in Aboriginal and Torres Strait
      Islander patients with diabetic macular oedema: The OASIS study (a randomised
      control trial).
PG  - 522-533
LID - 10.1111/ceo.14079 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Frequent intravitreal anti-VEGF injections are impractical for many
      Aboriginal patients with diabetic macular oedema (DMO). The longer acting
      intravitreal dexamethasone implant (DEX-implant) is approved for DMO but has not 
      been assessed in an Aboriginal population. METHODS: This was a prospective,
      multicentre, randomised, single-masked, non-inferiority clinical trial.
      Aboriginal adults from Western Australia with DMO were randomised to receive
      3-monthly DEX-implant, or monthly intravitreal bevacizumab. The primary outcome
      was the change in best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) at 12 months. RESULTS: The 
      final endpoint was analysed for 24 DEX-implant and 28 bevacizumab injection eyes.
      Mean BCVA improved by 4.0 letters (-0.08 LogMAR) in the DEX-implant group and
      worsened by 5.5 letters (0.11 LogMAR) in the bevacizumab group. Before adjusting 
      for cataract surgery, the upper bound of the two-sided 90% CI for the DEX-implant
      was 3.5 letters (0.07 LogMAR), which met non-inferiority criteria. The BCVA of
      remote participants who received the DEX-implant improved by 5.5 letters (0.11
      LogMAR), compared to an 18.5 letter (0.37 LogMAR) decline for bevacizumab (p =
      0.04). The incidence of steroid-induced ocular hypertension for the DEX-implant
      was 33.3%. CONCLUSIONS: Before adjusting for the effect of cataract surgery, the 
      DEX-implant was non-inferior to bevacizumab for treating DMO in Aboriginal
      participants. In remote participants, the DEX-implant surpassed non-inferiority
      to achieve superior outcomes to bevacizumab. The incidence of steroid-induced
      hypertension was comparable to that reported in non-Aboriginal populations. We
      provide guidelines for the judicious use of DEX-implant among Aboriginal people, 
      and a framework for performing ophthalmic clinical trials in Aboriginal
      communities.

AB  - PURPOSE: Axenfeld-Rieger syndrome encompasses a group of developmental disorders 
      affecting the anterior chamber structures of the eye, with associated systemic
      features in some cases. This study aims to compare the difference in anterior
      segment phenotypes such as those involving the cornea, iris, lens, and anterior
      chamber angle between cases with disease-causing sequence variations in FOXC1 and
      PITX2 . METHODS: This cross-sectional study involved 61 individuals, from 32
      families with pathogenic FOXC1 or PITX2 variants, who were registered with the
      Australian and New Zealand Registry of Advanced Glaucoma. RESULTS: The median age
      of the cohort was 39 years at the time of last assessment (range 3-85 years;
      females, 54%). Thirty-two patients had pathogenic variants in the FOXC1 gene, and
      29 patients had pathogenic variants in the PITX2 gene. Corneal abnormalities were
      more common in individuals with FOXC1 variants (18/36, 50%) than those with PITX2
      variants (4/25, 16%; P = 0.007). Iris abnormalities such as hypoplasia ( P =
      0.008) and pseudopolycoria ( P = 0.001) were more common in individuals with
      PITX2 variants than those with FOXC1 variants. Glaucoma was present in 72% of
      participants. Corneal decompensation was positively associated with corneal
      abnormalities ( P < 0.001), glaucoma surgery ( P = 0.025), and cataract surgery (
      P = 0.002). CONCLUSIONS: Corneal abnormalities were more common in individuals
      with FOXC1 than in those with PITX2 variants and were often associated with early
      onset glaucoma. These findings highlight that patients with FOXC1 variations
      require close follow-up and monitoring throughout infancy and into adulthood.

TI  - Atypical Conjunctival Lesion as the Initial Presentation of Granulomatosis With
      Polyangiitis in an Adolescent Male.
LID - 10.1097/ICO.0000000000003015 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to report the first case of a conjunctival
      granulomatous lesion as the presenting sign of granulomatous polyangiitis (GPA)
      in a pediatric patient. METHODS: This study is a case report. RESULTS: A
      14-year-old Hispanic boy presented with a conjunctival lesion on the inferior
      bulbar conjunctiva of the right eye associated with diffuse conjunctival
      injection. The mass progressively grew and became painful over the course of 6
      weeks. No retinal or orbital abnormalities were noted on examination. The lesion 
      was excised, and histopathological analysis was consistent with granulomatous
      inflammation. The lesion recurred after 15 months, and a second excisional biopsy
      was performed. The lesion again slowly recurred, and on presentation to our
      clinic, an elevated lesion in the inferior limbal/bulbar conjunctiva of the right
      eye was noted from 4 to 8 o'clock with accompanying forniceal shortening. Five
      months after the second excision, the patient developed flu-like symptoms with
      polyarthralgia. A full diagnostic workup revealed multiple pulmonary nodules on
      chest imaging, proteinuria on urinalysis, and a positive c-antineutrophil
      cytoplasmic antibody on serological studies. Based on these findings, the patient
      underwent a kidney biopsy which showed pauci-immune crescentic
      glomerulonephritis, consistent with a diagnosis of GPA. The patient achieved
      disease remission with rituximab. Despite treatment, the conjunctival lesion did 
      not regress and remained unchanged in size for 3 years with periodic episodes of 
      inflammation. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first documented case of a conjunctival
      mass as the initial presenting feature of pediatric GPA. The presence of
      granulomatous inflammation on histopathology and recurrences after excision
      should raise suspicion for GPA in children and adults.

TI  - Unprofessional behaviours experienced by hospital staff: qualitative analysis of 
      narrative comments in a longitudinal survey across seven hospitals in Australia.
PG  - 410
LID - 10.1186/s12913-022-07763-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Unprofessional behaviours of healthcare staff have negative impacts
      on organisational outcomes, patient safety and staff well-being. The objective of
      this study was to undertake a qualitative analysis of narrative responses from
      the Longitudinal Investigation of Negative Behaviours survey (LION), to develop a
      comprehensive understanding of hospital staff experiences of unprofessional
      behaviours and their impact on staff and patients. The LION survey identified
      staff experiences and perceptions related to unprofessional behaviours within
      hospitals. METHODS: Two open-ended questions within the LION survey invited
      descriptions of unprofessional staff behaviours across seven hospitals in three
      Australian states between December 2017 and November 2018. Respondents were from 
      medical, nursing, allied health, management, and support services roles in the
      hospitals. Data were qualitatively analysed using Directed Content Analysis
      (DCA). RESULTS: From 5178 LION survey responses, 32% (n = 1636) of participants
      responded to the two open-ended questions exploring staff experiences of
      unprofessional behaviours across the hospital sites surveyed. Three primary
      themes and 11 secondary themes were identified spanning, i) individual
      unprofessional behaviours, ii) negative impacts of unprofessional behaviours on
      staff well-being, psychological safety, and employee experience, as well as on
      patient care, well-being, and safety, and iii) organisational factors associated 
      with staff unprofessional behaviours. CONCLUSION: Unprofessional behaviours are
      experienced by hospital staff across all professional groups and functions. Staff
      conceptualise, perceive and experience unprofessional behaviours in diverse ways.
      These behaviours can be understood as enactments that either negatively impact
      other staff, patients or the organisational outcomes of team cohesion, work
      efficiency and efficacy. A perceived lack of organisational action based on
      existing reporting and employee feedback appears to erode employee confidence in 
      hospital leaders and their ability to effectively address and mitigate
      unprofessional behaviours.

TI  - Lymphadenectomy in Primary Fallopian Tube Cancer is Associated with Improved
      Survival.
PG  - 1417-1423
LID - 10.1080/08941939.2022.2048142 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Primary fallopian tube cancer (PFTC) shares the same
      diagnostic and management guidelines with epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC). The
      LION trail raised concerns regarding the role of systematic pelvic and
      para-aortic lymphadenectomy during debulking surgery. We aimed to evaluate the
      significance of lymphadenectomy in PFTC survival. METHODS: This retrospective
      study analyzed the clinical features and survival of patients with PFTC who
      underwent primary surgery in our center between January 2013 and October 2020.
      RESULTS: Sixty-one patients diagnosed with PFTC were included in the study.
      Twenty-five (41.0%, 25/61) were diagnosed with FIGO (International Federation of 
      Gynecology and Obstetrics) stages I/II and 36 (59.0%, 36/61) were diagnosed with 
      stage III/IV. Twenty-nine (47.5%, 29/61) underwent pelvic lymphadenectomy with or
      without para-aortic lymphadenectomy, among which 12 (41.4%, 12/29) had lymph node
      metastasis confirmed by postoperative pathology. The mean progression-free
      survival was 60.4 months in the lymphadenectomy group and 37.8 months in the
      no-lymphadenectomy group (p = 0.042, HR 0.374, 95% CI 0.145-0.966). CONCLUSIONS: 
      PFTC is often diagnosed earlier and has a better prognosis than EOC. Most
      patients with PFTC would benefit from lymphadenectomy. However, the extent to
      which this association translates to a more diverse population needs to be
      further identified.

TI  - SIBLING CONCORDANCE IN SYMPTOM ONSET AND ATROPHY GROWTH RATES IN STARGARDT
      DISEASE USING ULTRA-WIDEFIELD FUNDUS AUTOFLUORESCENCE.
PG  - 1545-1559
LID - 10.1097/IAE.0000000000003477 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate concordance in symptom onset, area of dark
      autofluorescence (DAF), and growth rate (GR) between Stargardt disease siblings
      at an age-matched time point. METHODS: In this retrospective longitudinal study
      of sibling pairs with identical biallelic ABCA4 variants, age at symptom onset,
      best-corrected visual acuity, atrophy area, and effective radius of DAF on
      ultra-widefield fundus autofluorescence were recorded. Absolute intersibling
      differences for both eyes were compared with absolute interocular differences
      using the Mann-Whitney test. RESULTS: Overall 39 patients from 19 families were
      recruited. In 16 families, age-matched best-corrected visual acuity and DAF were 
      compared between siblings. In 8 families, DAF GR was compared. The median (range)
      absolute difference in age at symptom onset between siblings was 3 (0-35) years. 
      Absolute intersibling differences in age-matched best-corrected visual acuity
      were greater than interocular differences ( P = 0.01). Similarly, absolute
      intersibling differences in DAF area and radius were greater than interocular
      differences ( P = 0.04 for area and P = 0.001 for radius). Differences between
      absolute interocular and intersibling GR were not statistically significant ( P =
      0.44 for area GR and P = 0.61 for radius GR). CONCLUSION: There was significant
      discordance in age-matched best-corrected visual acuity and DAF beyond the
      expected limits of interocular asymmetry. Lack of significant intersibling
      differences in GR warrants further investigation.

AB  - Protein Energy Malnutrition (PEM) has lifelong consequences on brain development 
      and cognitive function. We studied the lifelong developmental trajectories of
      resting-state EEG source activity in 66 individuals with histories of Protein
      Energy Malnutrition (PEM) limited to the first year of life and in 83 matched
      classmate controls (CON) who are all participants of the 49 years longitudinal
      Barbados Nutrition Study (BNS). qEEGt source z-spectra measured deviation from
      normative values of EEG rhythmic activity sources at 5-11 years of age and 40
      years later at 45-51 years of age. The PEM group showed qEEGt abnormalities in
      childhood, including a developmental delay in alpha rhythm maturation and an
      insufficient decrease in beta activity. These profiles may be correlated with
      accelerated cognitive decline.

AB  - As the slow-release fertilizer, oil-coated fertilizer can not only slow down the 
      nutrients loss, but also have outstanding advantages in controlling the nutrients
      release. Based on a large number of literature, this paper systematically
      investigated the composition, classification, properties and preparation of
      oil-coated fertilizers, summarizes the challenges faced by the oil-coated
      fertilizers and offers a few suggestions for the future research. Through
      literature research, some important conclusions were found: (1) Oil-coated
      fertilizers are generally composed of core fertilizers and coated oil layers, and
      some have active interlayers. (2) Vegetable oils has the characteristics of easy 
      degradation, water resistance and impact resistance, and the nutrient release
      curves of vegetable oil coated fertilizer in soil and still water are "S" type.
      (3) The modified polyurethane exhibits good compatibility with urea, and can
      control the release of N in a long period of time, which is 30 days longer than
      the N release life of ordinary polyurethane-coated fertilizers. (4) Oil-coated
      fertilizers can reduce the loss of N by slowing down the hydrolysis rate of urea 
      and the nitrification from NH4(+) to NO3(-), which reduces the N2O release by
      70-80% compared to the uncoated fertilizers. Moreover, the paper also proposes a 
      new preparation method of oil-coated material.

TI  - DETECTION OF VECTOR-BORNE INFECTIONS IN LIONS AND TIGERS AT TWO ZOOS IN TENNESSEE
      AND OKLAHOMA, USA.
PG  - 50-59

AB  - Protozoal and bacterial vector-borne infections are frequently diagnosed in
      domestic felids. However, with the exception of Mycoplasma haemofelis and
      Cytauxzoon felis, their occurrence in managed nondomestic felids housed in the
      United States is largely unknown. Following a case in February 2020 of fulminant 
      cytauxzoonosis in an African lion (Panthera leo), EDTA-whole blood samples were
      collected opportunistically from February 2020 through June 2020 from 34 adult
      tigers (Panthera tigris) and eight adult African lions from the same sanctuary in
      eastern Tennessee as well as 14 adult tigers from a zoo in southern Oklahoma.
      Samples were analyzed for Cytauxzoon felis, Bartonella spp., hemotropic
      Mycoplasma, Rickettsia spp., Anaplasma spp., Ehrlichia spp., Babesia spp., and
      Hepatozoon spp. DNA by PCR amplification. All animals were asymptomatic at the
      time of collection. None of the Oklahoma animals were positive for vector-borne
      organisms, but these pathogens were detected in tigers at the Tennessee facility,
      including Cytauxzoon felis (11.8%), "Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum" (5.9%), 
      and Ehrlichia ewingii (2.9%). During the study period, two animals developed
      clinical signs of cytauxzoonosis and were assessed for vector-borne infections as
      part of their diagnostic evaluation. This study documents the presence of
      tick-borne diseases in managed nondomestic felids in the southeastern United
      States and underscores that ectoparasite control measures should be practiced to 
      minimize exposure of carnivores in managed care.

      intracranial pressure estimation.
PG  - 5190
LID - 10.1038/s41598-022-09151-7 [doi]
AB  - Intracranial pressure (ICP) includes the brain, optic nerve, and spinal cord
      pressures; it influences blood flow to those structures. Pathological elevation
      in ICP results in structural damage through various mechanisms, which adversely
      affects outcomes in traumatic brain injury and stroke. Currently, invasive
      procedures which tap directly into the cerebrospinal fluid are required to
      measure this pressure. Recent fluidic engineering modelling analogous to the
      ocular vascular flow suggests that retinal venous pulse amplitudes are
      predictably influenced by downstream pressures, suggesting that ICP could be
      estimated by analysing this pulse signal. We used this modelling theory and our
      photoplethysmographic (PPG) retinal venous pulse amplitude measurement system to 
      measure amplitudes in 30 subjects undergoing invasive ICP measurements by lumbar 
      puncture (LP) or external ventricular drain (EVD). We estimated ICP from these
      amplitudes using this modelling and found it to be accurate with a mean absolute 
      error of 3.0 mmHg and a slope of 1.00 (r = 0.91). Ninety-four percent of
      differences between the PPG and invasive method were between - 5.5 and + 4.0
      mmHg, which compares favourably to comparisons between LP and EVD. This type of
      modelling may be useful for understanding retinal vessel pulsatile fluid dynamics
      and may provide a method for non-invasive ICP measurement.

TI  - The "Historical Materials BAG": A New Facilitated Access to Synchrotron X-ray
      Diffraction Analyses for Cultural Heritage Materials at the European Synchrotron 
      Radiation Facility.
LID - 1997 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27061997 [doi]
AB  - The European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF) has recently commissioned the 
      new Extremely Brilliant Source (EBS). The gain in brightness as well as the
      continuous development of beamline instruments boosts the beamline performances, 
      in particular in terms of accelerated data acquisition. This has motivated the
      development of new access modes as an alternative to standard proposals for
      access to beamtime, in particular via the "block allocation group" (BAG) mode.
      Here, we present the recently implemented "historical materials BAG": a community
      proposal giving to 10 European institutes the opportunity for guaranteed beamtime
      at two X-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) beamlines-ID13, for 2D high lateral
      resolution XRPD mapping, and ID22 for high angular resolution XRPD bulk
      analyses-with a particular focus on applications to cultural heritage. The
      capabilities offered by these instruments, the specific hardware and software
      developments to facilitate and speed-up data acquisition and data processing are 
      detailed, and the first results from this new access are illustrated with recent 
      applications to pigments, paintings, ceramics and wood.

TI  - Incidence of cervical, breast and colorectal cancers between 2010 and 2015 in
      people living with HIV in France.
PG  - e0261069
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0261069 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to evaluate the incidence rates between 2010 and 2015 for
      invasive cervical cancer (ICC), breast cancer (BC), and colorectal cancer (CRC)
      in people living with HIV (PLWH) in France, and to compare them with those in the
      French general population. These cancers are targeted by the national
      cancer-screening program. SETTING: This is a retrospective study based on the
      longitudinal data of the French Dat'AIDS cohort. METHODS: Standardized incidence 
      ratios (SIR) for ICC and BC, and incidence rates for all three cancers were
      calculated overall and for specific sub-populations according to nadir CD4 cell
      count, HIV transmission category, HIV diagnosis period, and HCV coinfection.
      RESULTS: The 2010-2015 CRC incidence rate was 25.0 [95% confidence interval (CI):
      18.6-33.4] per 100,000 person-years, in 44,642 PLWH (both men and women).
      Compared with the general population, the ICC incidence rate was significantly
      higher in HIV-infected women both overall (SIR = 1.93, 95% CI: 1.18-3.14) and in 
      the following sub-populations: nadir CD4 </= 200 cells/mm3 (SIR = 2.62, 95% CI:
      1.45-4.74), HIV transmission through intravenous drug use (SIR = 5.14, 95% CI:
      1.93-13.70), HCV coinfection (SIR = 3.52, 95% CI: 1.47-8.47) and HIV diagnosis
      before 2000 (SIR = 2.06, 95% CI: 1.07-3.97). Conversely, the BC incidence rate
      was significantly lower in the study sample than in the general population (SIR =
      0.56, 95% CI: 0.42-0.73). CONCLUSION: The present study showed no significant
      linear trend between 2010 and 2015 in the incidence rates of the three cancers
      explored in the PLWH study sample. Specific recommendations for ICC screening are
      still required for HIV-infected women and should focus on sub-populations at
      greatest risk.

      devices for flat (K1), steep (K2) and mean (Km) keratometry for anterior,
      posterior and total cornea, lens thickness (LT), anterior chamber depth (ACD),
      central corneal thickness (CCT), white to white (WTW) and axial length (AL).
      Generalised Estimating Equations were used to control for within-patient
      between-eye correlations. Inter-device differences were considered clinically
      significant if they were likely to alter the spherical refractive outcome by
      0.25D or more. RESULTS: 159 eyes of 91 patients (41 male, 50 female) were
      included. Statistically significant differences were found for K1, K2 and Km for 
      anterior, posterior and total cornea. When Anterion was compared to IOLMaster
      700, the mean differences were as follows: anterior K1: -0.17D, anterior K2:
      -0.18D, anterior Km: -0.17D, posterior K1: -0.38D, posterior K2: -0.36D,
      posterior Km: -0.37D, total K1: -0.65D, total K2: -0.82D, total Km: -0.74D. The
      difference in posterior and total K metrics were clinically significant.
      Statistically significant differences were noted for LT: 0.159mm, CCT: -0.004mm, 
      ACD: 0.054mm and WTW: -0.152mm, although these were not found to be clinically
      significant. There was no significant difference between devices for AL.
      CONCLUSION: This study found statistically and clinically significant differences
      for both posterior and total keratometry between Anterion and IOLMaster 700.
      Posterior and total corneal parameters cannot be considered interchangeable
      between devices.

TI  - Scoping the psychological support practices of Australian health professionals
      working with people with primary brain tumor and their families.
LID - 10.1002/pon.5929 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to scope the psychological support practices of
      Australian health professionals providing supportive care to adults with primary 
      brain tumor. METHOD: Health professionals from multidisciplinary organizations
      and cancer support services completed an online survey focused on psychological
      support for people with brain tumor (PwBT) and family members, and perceived
      barriers or gaps in support provision. RESULTS: 107 professionals, mainly from
      psychology (45%), nursing (20%), and social work (10%) backgrounds, completed the
      survey. Scope of practice differed according to discipline, with psychologists
      and nurses most likely to screen for psychological distress (71%-76%), and
      psychologists more typically providing at least one psychological support session
      (78%). Psychologists were more likely to screen for cognitive impairment (31%),
      whereas nurses and social workers more commonly provided family-based support
      (62%-73%). Psychological support was more frequently provided in the long-term
      management phase (78%) than early post-diagnosis/treatment (45%). System-level
      barriers to accessing psychological support were most frequently identified,
      which included limited resources and funding, insufficient staff time, lengthy
      waitlists and costs, poor service coordination, and lack of staff with brain
      tumor-specific training. CONCLUSIONS: The provision of psychological support for 
      PwBT varies according to discipline, setting and management phase. Further
      research on different models of psychosocial care is needed to inform strategies 
      to address organizational and policy factors impacting professionals' scope of
      practice.

TI  - Sorting and packaging of RNA into extracellular vesicles shape intracellular
      transcript levels.
PG  - 72
LID - 10.1186/s12915-022-01277-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Extracellular vesicles (EVs) are released by nearly every cell type
      and have attracted much attention for their ability to transfer protein and
      diverse RNA species from donor to recipient cells. Much attention has been given 
      so far to the features of EV short RNAs such as miRNAs. However, while the
      presence of mRNA and long noncoding RNA (lncRNA) transcripts in EVs has also been
      reported by multiple different groups, the properties and function of these
      longer transcripts have been less thoroughly explored than EV miRNA.
      Additionally, the impact of EV export on the transcriptome of exporting cells has
      remained almost completely unexamined. Here, we globally investigate mRNA and
      lncRNA transcripts in endothelial EVs in multiple different conditions. RESULTS: 
      In basal conditions, long RNA transcripts enriched in EVs have longer than
      average half-lives and distinctive stability-related sequence and structure
      characteristics including shorter transcript length, higher exon density, and
      fewer 3' UTR A/U-rich elements. EV-enriched long RNA transcripts are also
      enriched in HNRNPA2B1 binding motifs and are impacted by HNRNPA2B1 depletion,
      implicating this RNA-binding protein in the sorting of long RNA to EVs. After
      signaling-dependent modification of the cellular transcriptome, we observed that,
      unexpectedly, the rate of EV enrichment relative to cells was altered for many
      mRNA and lncRNA transcripts. This change in EV enrichment was negatively
      correlated with intracellular abundance, with transcripts whose export to EVs
      increased showing decreased abundance in cells and vice versa. Correspondingly,
      after treatment with inhibitors of EV secretion, levels of mRNA and lncRNA
      transcripts that are normally highly exported to EVs increased in cells,
      indicating a measurable impact of EV export on the long RNA transcriptome of the 
      exporting cells. Compounds with different mechanisms of inhibition of EV
      secretion affected the cellular transcriptome differently, suggesting the
      existence of multiple EV subtypes with different long RNA profiles. CONCLUSIONS: 
      We present evidence for an impact of EV physiology on the characteristics of
      EV-producing cell transcriptomes. Our work suggests a new paradigm in which the
      sorting and packaging of transcripts into EVs participate, together with
      transcription and RNA decay, in controlling RNA homeostasis and shape the
      cellular long RNA abundance profile.

TI  - Different HSP90 Inhibitors Exert Divergent Effect on Myxoid Liposarcoma In Vitro 
      and In Vivo.
LID - 624 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines10030624 [doi]
AB  - The therapeutic options for patients with relapsed or metastatic myxoid
      liposarcoma (MLS) remain scarce and there is currently no targeted therapy
      available. Inhibition of the HSP90 family of chaperones has been suggested as a
      possible therapeutic option for patients with MLS. However, the clinical effect
      of different HSP90 inhibitors vary considerably and no comparative study in MLS
      has been performed. Here, we evaluated the effects of the HSP90 inhibitors
      17-DMAG, AUY922 and STA-9090 on MLS cell lines and in an MLS patient-derived
      xenograft (PDX) model. Albeit all drugs inhibited in vitro growth of MLS cell
      lines, the in vivo responses were discrepant. Whereas 17-DMAG inhibited tumor
      growth, AUY922 surprisingly led to increased tumor growth and a more aggressive
      morphological phenotype. In vitro, 17-DMAG and STA-9090 reduced the activity of
      the MAPK and PI3K/AKT signaling pathways, whereas AUY922 led to a compensatory
      upregulation of downstream ERK. Furthermore, all three tested HSP90 inhibitors
      displayed a synergistic combination effect with trabectidin, but not with
      doxorubicin. In conclusion, our results indicate that different HSP90 inhibitors,
      albeit having the same target, can vary significantly in downstream effects and
      treatment outcomes. These results should be considered before proceeding into
      clinical trials against MLS or other malignancies.

AB  - The purpose of this study was to adopt the Personal Assets Framework (PAF) to
      examine the immediate, short-term, and long-term developmental outcomes
      associated with relative age effects (RAEs) in male cricket. As such, this study 
      was comprised of three aims: (a) examine the birth quarter (BQ) distribution of
      players throughout the England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) national talent
      pathway (i.e., Regional U15, Regional U17, England U19, England Lions, England
      T20, England ODI, and England Test; n = 1800; immediate timescale), (b) explore
      the youth-to-senior transitions based on BQ and skill-set (i.e., batters and
      bowlers; short-term timescale), and (c) analyse the average number of games
      played at senior levels based on BQ and skill-set (i.e., long-term timescale). A 
      chi-square goodness of fit test, Cramer's V, odds ratios, and 95% confidence
      intervals were used to compare the BQ distributions of each cohort against the
      expected BQ distributions. In the immediate timescale, results showed that
      relatively older players were overrepresented throughout all the youth levels (p 
      &lt; 0.05, V = 0.16-0.30), whereas there were no differences at senior levels (p 
      &gt; 0.05, V = 0.05-0.15). In the short-term timescale, when the senior cohorts
      were compared to the expected BQ distributions based on the Regional U15 cohort, 
      relatively younger players were more likely to transition from youth to senior
      levels (p &lt; 0.05, V = 0.22-0.37). In the long-term timescale, relatively older
      batters were selected for more games (p &lt; 0.05, V = 0.18-0.51), whereas
      relatively younger bowlers were selected for more games (p &lt; 0.05, V =
      0.17-0.39). Moving forward, it is important for researchers and practitioners to 
      better understand how (bi)annual-age grouping shapes developmental outcomes in
      across different timescales (i.e., immediate, short-term, and long-term), as well
      as consider alternative grouping strategies and RAE solutions.

TI  - Dynamics and Mass Balance of Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons in and Around the
      Seto Inland Sea, Japan.

AB  - Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) were analyzed to elucidate the
      distribution, ecological risk, pathways, and fluxes of these pollutants in and
      around the Seto Inland Sea, an industrialized coastal region of Japan. High
      molecular weight PAHs (5-6 rings) were primarily found in regions close to the
      bay estuaries, and their proportions decreased at distances further from the
      estuaries (offshore areas), where low molecular weight PAHs (2-4 rings) were more
      ubiquitous. Screening-level risk assessments revealed that the PAHs found in the 
      sediments should have no adverse effects on benthic communities. A mass balance
      for PAHs in the Seto Inland Sea, calculated based on data collected in the field 
      and published literature findings, showed the PAH flux into the Seto Inland Sea
      from atmospheric deposition were ca. 6 times higher than that from riverine
      inflows. Comparison of the amount of the PAH mass flux between the Seto Inland
      Sea and the sea of the Europe and Asian countries indicated that the Seto Inland 
      Sea is less polluted than the Gulf of Lion, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Bohai 
      Sea, China and more polluted than the Yellow Sea. This paper is the first to
      determine the fluxes of PAHs in the coastal region of Japan.

AB  - SignificanceThe analysis of complex systems with many degrees of freedom
      generally involves the definition of low-dimensional collective variables more
      amenable to physical understanding. Their dynamics can be modeled by generalized 
      Langevin equations, whose coefficients have to be estimated from simulations of
      the initial high-dimensional system. These equations feature a memory kernel
      describing the mutual influence of the low-dimensional variables and their
      environment. We introduce and implement an approach where the generalized
      Langevin equation is designed to maximize the statistical likelihood of the
      observed data. This provides an efficient way to generate reduced models to study
      dynamical properties of complex processes such as chemical reactions in solution,
      conformational changes in biomolecules, or phase transitions in condensed matter 
      systems.

TI  - Iris Retraction Without Hypotony.
PG  - 1273-1279
LID - 10.1007/s40123-022-00497-9 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: All published cases of iris retraction syndrome have been associated
      with low intraocular pressure. We report here a case clinically indistinguishable
      from iris retraction syndrome except for the absence of hypotony, which has not
      been previously described in the literature. OBSERVATIONS: A 35-year-old woman
      with a history of atopic dermatitis developed a rapidly progressive anterior
      subcapsular cataract and acute uveitis. During follow-up, the presence of
      bilateral iris retraction was noted, while ocular pressure was either normal or
      elevated, and the position did not normalize with pupillary dilation. The
      clinical course was complicated by retinal detachment and posterior cyclitic
      membrane, which was managed with pars plana vitrectomy, lensectomy, and
      dissection of cyclitic membrane. The case was further complicated by ocular
      hypertension attributed to steroid response and formation of an epiretinal
      membrane. Following micropulse cyclophotocoagulation, placement of an Ahmed tube 
      shunt, epiretinal membrane peel, and placement of secondary intraocular lens, our
      patient eventually had a good visual outcome. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE:
      Hypotony is generally recognized as a key physiological step in the development
      of iris retraction syndrome. Our case demonstrates that posterior bowing of the
      iris can occur in the absence of hypotony, and suggests that an alternative
      mechanism involving posterior cyclitic membrane may be responsible.

TI  - Self-care practice among adult hypertensive patients at ambulatory clinic of
      tertiary teaching Hospital in Ethiopia: a cross-sectional study.
PG  - 23
LID - 10.1186/s40545-022-00421-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Globally, hypertension is a major public health problem and a strong 
      predictor of cardiovascular disease complications. To reduce and prevent
      complications from hypertension, it is important to adapt self-care behaviors.
      This study aimed to assess the self-care practices of adult hypertensive patients
      at a tertiary teaching hospital in Ethiopia. METHODS: A health facility-based
      prospective cross-sectional study was conducted at Jimma Medical Center in
      Ethiopia between February 2021 and July 2021. Binary and logistic regression was 
      performed to assess the strength of associations between independent and
      dependent variables. Data entry and analysis were done using Statistical Package 
      for social science (SPSS) software version 22.0. A p-value < 0.05 was considered 
      to declare statistical significance. RESULTS: From a total of 422 respondents
      included to the study, male accounted 55.7% and the mean +/- SD age of the
      respondents was 58.7 +/- 9.75 years. About 53.1% of patients had poor self-care
      practices toward hypertension. Not attending formal education [AOR = 2.15; 95% CI
      (1.74, 6.39); p </= 0.001], uncontrolled blood pressure [AOR = 2.14 95% CI (1.27,
      3.61); p = 0.003], chronic disease co-morbidity [AOR = 1.48; 95% CI (0.25, 7.73);
      p </= 0.001], unfavorable attitude toward hypertension[AOR = 3.13; 95% CI (1.95, 
      7.52); p </= 0.001], and poor social support [AOR = 2.75; 95% CI (1.45, 6.43); p 
      </= 0.001] were independent predictors of poor self-care practice. CONCLUSION:
      The level of self-care practices for hypertension in the study area was low. In
      particular, the level of adherence to the DASH diet, exercise, and weight control
      was very low. Patient-specific targeted interventions are required to improve
      self-care practices for hypertension.

      Framework.
PG  - 781770
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2022.781770 [doi]
AB  - Since the outbreak of SARS-CoV-2 in 2019, the Chinese horseshoe bats were
      considered as a potential original host of SARS-CoV-2. In addition, cats, tigers,
      lions, mints, and ferrets were naturally or experimentally infected with
      SARS-CoV-2. For the surveillance and control of this highly infectious disease,
      it is critical to trace susceptible animals and predict the consequence of
      potential mutations at the binding region of viral spike protein and host ACE2
      protein. This study proposed a novel bioinformatics framework to systematically
      trace susceptible animals to SARS-CoV-2 and predict the binding affinity between 
      susceptible animals' mutated/un-mutated ACE2 receptors. As a result, we
      identified a few animals posing a potential risk of infection with SARS-CoV-2
      using the docking analysis of ACE2 protein and viral spike protein. The binding
      affinity of some of these species is weaker than that of humans but more potent
      than that of Chinese horseshoe bats. We also found that a few point mutations in 
      human ACE2 protein or viral spike protein could significantly enhance their
      binding affinity, posing an enormous potential threat to public health. The
      ancestors of the Omicron may evolve rapidly through the accumulation of mutations
      in infecting the host and jumped into human beings. These findings indicate that 
      if the epidemic expands, there may be a human-animal-human transmission route,
      which will increase the difficulty of disease prevention and control.

TI  - Prevalence of soil-transmitted helminths infections among preschool and
      school-age children in Ethiopia: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 9
LID - 10.1186/s41256-022-00239-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: There is a lack of comprehensive national data on prevalence,
      geographical distribution of different species, and temporal trends in
      soil-helminthiasis (STHs). Therefore, this study aimed to provide a summary and
      location of the available data on STHs infection among preschool and school-age
      children in Ethiopia. METHODS: The search was carried out in Medline via PubMed, 
      Scopus, Science Direct, Web of Science, and Google Scholar on data published
      between 1997 to February 2020 for studies describing the rate of STHs infection
      among preschool and school-age in Ethiopian. We followed the Patient,
      Intervention, Comparison, and Outcome (PICO) approach to identify the studies.
      Meta-regression was performed to understand the trends and to summarize the
      prevalence using the "metaprop" command using STATA software version 14.0
      RESULTS: A total of 29,311 of the 61,690 children examined during the period
      under review were infected with one or more species of intestinal parasites
      yielding an overall prevalence of 48% (95% CI: 43-53%). The overall pooled
      estimate of STHs was 33% (95% CI: 28-38%). The prevalence was 44% (95% CI:
      31-58%) in SNNPR, 34% (95% CI: 28-41%) in Amhara region, 31% (95% CI: 19-43%) in 
      Oromia region and 10% (95% CI: 7-12%) in Tigray region. Soil-transmitted
      helminths infection rate has been decreasing from 44% (95% CI: 30-57%) pre-Mass
      Drug Administration (MDA) era (1997-2012) to 30% (95% CI: 25-34%) post-MDA
      (2013-2020), although statistically not significant (p = 0.45). A lumbricoides
      was the predominant species with a prevalence of 17%. CONCLUSION: Southern
      Nations Nationalities and Peoples Region, Amhara, and Oromia regions carry the
      highest-burden and are categorized to Moderate Risk Zones (MRZ) and therefore,
      requiring MDA once annually with Albendazole or Mebendazole. The prevalence of
      STHs decreased after MDA compared to before MDA, but the decline was not
      statistically significant. A. lumbricoides was the predominant species of STHs
      among preschool and school-age children in Ethiopia. The high prevalence of STHs 
      observed in this review, underscores the need for better control and prevention
      strategies in Ethiopia.

TI  - Symbiont-conferred immunity interacts with effects of parasitoid genotype and
      intraguild predation to affect aphid immunity in a clone-specific fashion.
PG  - 33
LID - 10.1186/s12862-022-01991-1 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Host-parasite interactions represent complex co-evolving systems in
      which genetic and associated phenotypic variation within a species can
      significantly affect selective pressures on traits, such as host immunity, in the
      other. While often modelled as a two-species interaction between host and
      parasite, some systems are more complex due to effects of host enemies,
      intraguild predation, and endosymbionts, all of which affect host immunity.
      However, it remains unclear how these factors, combined with genetic variation in
      the host and the parasitoid, affect host immunity. We address this question in an
      important agricultural pest system, the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, which
      shows significant intraspecific variability in immunity to the parasitoid wasp
      Aphidius ervi. In a complex experiment, we use a quantitative genetic design in
      the parasitoid, two ecologically different aphid lineages and the aphid lion
      Chrysoperla carnea as an intraguild predator to unravel the complex
      interdependencies. RESULTS: We demonstrate that aphid immunity as a key trait of 
      this complex host-parasite system is affected by intraspecific genetic variation 
      in the parasitoid and the aphid, the interaction of intraspecific genetic
      variation with intraguild predation, and differences in defensive endosymbionts
      between aphid lineages. Further, aphid lineages differ in their altruistic
      behaviour whereby infested aphids move away from the clonal colony to facilitate 
      predation. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings provide new insights into the influence of
      endosymbiosis and genetic variability in an important host-parasitoid system
      which is influenced by natural enemies of the parasitoid and the aphid, including
      its endosymbiont communities. We show that endosymbiosis can mediate or influence
      the evolutionary arms race between aphids and their natural enemies. The outcome 
      of these complex interactions between species has significant implications for
      understanding the evolution of multitrophic systems, including eco-agricultural
      settings.

TI  - Towards standardizing retinal optical coherence tomography angiography: a review.
PG  - 63
LID - 10.1038/s41377-022-00740-9 [doi]
AB  - The visualization and assessment of retinal microvasculature are important in the
      study, diagnosis, monitoring, and guidance of treatment of ocular and systemic
      diseases. With the introduction of optical coherence tomography angiography
      (OCTA), it has become possible to visualize the retinal microvasculature
      volumetrically and without a contrast agent. Many lab-based and commercial
      clinical instruments, imaging protocols and data analysis methods and metrics,
      have been applied, often inconsistently, resulting in a confusing picture that
      represents a major barrier to progress in applying OCTA to reduce the burden of
      disease. Open data and software sharing, and cross-comparison and pooling of data
      from different studies are rare. These inabilities have impeded building the
      large databases of annotated OCTA images of healthy and diseased retinas that are
      necessary to study and define characteristics of specific conditions. This paper 
      addresses the steps needed to standardize OCTA imaging of the human retina to
      address these limitations. Through review of the OCTA literature, we identify
      issues and inconsistencies and propose minimum standards for imaging protocols,
      data analysis methods, metrics, reporting of findings, and clinical practice and,
      where this is not possible, we identify areas that require further investigation.
      We hope that this paper will encourage the unification of imaging protocols in
      OCTA, promote transparency in the process of data collection, analysis, and
      reporting, and facilitate increasing the impact of OCTA on retinal healthcare
      delivery and life science investigations.

TI  - Parvimonas micra is associated with tumour immune profiles in molecular subtypes 
      of colorectal cancer.
LID - 10.1007/s00262-022-03179-4 [doi]
AB  - The importance of the tumour microbiome in different aspects of colorectal cancer
      (CRC) has been increasingly recognised, but many questions remain. The aim of
      this study was to explore the effect of specific CRC associated microbes on the
      tumour immune response, which has a considerable prognostic value in CRC. We
      applied specific qPCR to detect Parvimonas micra and Fusobacterium nucleatum in
      tumour tissues from an immunologically well-characterised cohort of 69 CRC
      patients. This cohort included detailed analyses of immune profiles based on flow
      cytometry and transcriptomics in tumour tissue and blood, along with
      comprehensive analyses of molecular subtypes. P. micra and F. nucleatum were
      detected in 24% and 64% of tumour tissues, respectively. We found a significant
      association of P. micra with high-grade tumours and tumours of CMS1 subtype. F.
      nucleatum was significantly associated with right-sided tumours, microsatellite
      instability, and CMS1 tumours. The immunological analyses revealed significant
      associations of P. micra with activated CD69(+) T lymphocytes and increased
      antigen-presenting HLA-DR(+) B lymphocytes. P. micra was also positively
      associated with M1 and M2 macrophage traits. The impact of P. micra tumour
      colonisation on the immune response was further assessed using transcriptomics in
      validation of our findings. No associations were found between F. nucleatum and
      immune profiles in this study. Our findings support novel associations between P.
      micra and the immune response in CRC. A better understanding of these
      interactions might help to identify important predictive and prognostic tools as 
      well as new targets for therapy.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Thygeson superficial punctate keratitis (TSPK) is clinically
      characterized by exacerbations and remissions of gray-white opacities within the 
      corneal epithelium, most often bilateral but may be asymmetric. Symptoms
      typically include photophobia, tearing, blurring, and eye irritation. Although
      disease progression and prognosis are well described, the exact cause is unknown.
      Hypotheses exist implicating virus-mediated immunity as the cause of TSPK
      following cases of viral keratitis; however, several polymerase chain reaction
      studies refute the infectious process concurrently with symptomatic TSPK. This is
      further supported by the consistent lack of response to antiviral and
      antibacterial treatment. A subset of dendritic cells known as Langerhans cells
      (LC) found within the corneal epithelium has been positively correlated with
      exacerbations of TSPK. Langerhans cells proliferate to protect and mitigate the
      cornea's inflammatory response, but the inflammatory triggers and relapses
      associated with TSPK are not well understood. Several topical drugs exist to
      treat inflammation related to TSPK; however, drug delivery is a major barrier to 
      treatment because of the tear film and epithelial barrier. Drug-eluting contact
      lenses that target intermediates of inflammation could serve as a more effective 
      treatment modality because of the increased bioavailability of the drugs. This
      review is an in-depth survey of the literature regarding the relationship between
      the origin and pathophysiology of LC and TSPK at the immunologic level. We also
      discuss potential pharmacotherapeutic interventions for TSPK prevention and
      treatment.

AB  - Type I interferon (IFN-I) plays a major role in antiviral and inflammatory
      processes of the infected host. In the bovine industry, the bovine respiratory
      disease complex is a major cause of economic and health problems. This disease is
      caused by interactions of pathogens, together with environmental and host
      factors. Several pathogens have been identified as causal agents of respiratory
      diseases in cattle. To better understand how primary infections by viruses
      predispose animals to further infections by pathogenic bacteria, tools to
      accurately detect antiviral and immunoregulatory cytokines are needed. To
      facilitate the detection and quantification of bovine IFN-I, we have established 
      a new specific and sensitive bioassay studies in the bovine host. This assay is
      based on a Madin-Darby Bovine Kidney (MDBK) cell line that carries a luciferase
      gene under the control of the IFN-I inducible bovine Mx1 promoter. Specific
      luciferase activity was measured after stimulation with serial dilutions of
      recombinant bovine alpha and beta IFNs and human IFN-alpha. With this novel
      bioassay we have successfully measured IFN-I production in supernatant from MDBK 
      cells after stimulation of Toll-like receptors (TLR3, TLR7 and TLR8) and
      RIG-I-like receptors (RIG-I and MDA5), after viral infection with bovine
      respiratory pathogens, but also in samples from infected calves. Finally, this
      new bioassay is an easy-to-use and low cost tool to measure the production of
      bovine Type-I Interferon.

TI  - A single-institution review of lacrimal gland biopsies between 1962 and 2017.
PG  - 1-9
LID - 10.1080/01676830.2022.2052113 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the clinical and histopathologic characteristics of lacrimal 
      gland biopsies at a tertiary academic center. METHODS: A retrospective chart
      review of patients undergoing lacrimal gland biopsy or excision between 1962 and 
      2017 was performed via the ocular pathology specimen log. All cases were reviewed
      for demographics, clinical presentation, and histopathologic diagnoses. RESULTS: 
      Four hundred and two eyes in 356 patients were included in the analysis. Median
      age was 49 (range 5-91) with a female predominance (255, 72%, p < .001). Most had
      unilateral involvement (308, 86.5%) and visual acuity of 20/50 or better (332
      eyes, 83%). Limitation in extraocular motility was present in 71 eyes (18%),
      relative afferent pupillary defect in 10 eyes (2.5%), and intraocular pressure 20
      mmHg or above in 80 eyes (20%). The pre-operative radiology report commented on
      the enlargement of the lacrimal gland in 236 eyes (58.7%), and lack thereof in 73
      eyes (18.2%). The most common histopathologic diagnoses were nonspecific
      inflammation or orbital pseudotumor (170, 42%), lymphoma (65, 16%), pleomorphic
      adenoma (22, 5.5%), adenoid cystic carcinoma (19, 4.7%), granulomatous
      inflammation (19, 4.7%), and normal lacrimal gland (16, 4%). Three hundred and
      seven cases were benign (76%) and 95 malignant (24%). The biopsy specimen was
      diagnostic in 343 (85%), and non-diagnostic in 59 (15%). CONCLUSIONS: This is a
      comprehensive review of one of the largest ocular pathology databases of lacrimal
      gland lesions. This study confirms the wide range of inflammatory and neoplastic 
      conditions affecting the lacrimal gland and highlights the nuances of
      histopathologic diagnoses and diagnostic yield of biopsies in clinical practice.

TI  - Effect of Cholesterol on Nano-Structural Alteration of Light-Activatable
      Liposomes via Laser Irradiation: Small Angle Neutron Scattering Study.
LID - 128548 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.colsurfa.2022.128548 [doi]
AB  - Although the light-activated liposomes have been extensively studied for drug
      delivery applications, the fundamental mechanism of the drug release based on
      lipid compositions has not been fully understood. Especially, despite the
      extensive use of cholesterol in the lipid composition, the role of cholesterol in
      the light-activated drug release has not been studied. In this study, the
      influence of cholesterol on drug release from light-responsive drug-encapsulated 
      liposomes after activated by near infrared (NIR) laser was investigated. We
      prepared methotrexate (MTX)-encapsulated DSPC liposomes consisting of 0 mol%
      (-Chol) or 35 mol% cholesterol (+Chol), with (+Au) or without gold nanorods (-Au)
      on the lipid bilayer to compare drug release, morphological changes, and
      nanostructures after laser irradiations. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM)
      and small angel neutron scattering (SANS) data revealed that only +Chol +Au
      liposomes showed partial aggregation of the liposomes after laser irradiation.
      Similar trends on the drug release and structural change were observed when the
      liposomes were heated to above chain-transition temperature. Overall, we have
      found that (1) inclusion of 35 mol% cholesterol enhanced the permeability of
      lipid bilayers above Tc; (2) the mechanism of laser-activated liposomal drug
      delivery is disrupting lipid bilayer membranes by the photothermal effect in the 
      presence of plasmonic materials. By understanding the fundamentals of the
      technology, precise controlled drug release at a targeted site with great
      stability and repeatability is anticipated.

AB  - The striatum mediates two learning modalities: goal-directed behavior in
      dorsomedial (DMS) and habits in dorsolateral (DLS) striata. The synaptic bases of
      these learnings are still elusive. Indeed, while ample research has described DLS
      plasticity, little remains known about DMS plasticity and its involvement in
      procedural learning. Here, we find symmetric and asymmetric anti-Hebbian
      spike-timing-dependent plasticity (STDP) in DMS and DLS, respectively, with
      opposite plasticity dominance upon increasing corticostriatal activity. During
      motor-skill learning, plasticity is engaged in DMS and striatonigral DLS neurons 
      only during early learning stages, whereas striatopallidal DLS neurons are
      mobilized only during late phases. With a mathematical modeling approach, we find
      that symmetric anti-Hebbian STDP favors memory flexibility, while asymmetric
      anti-Hebbian STDP favors memory maintenance, consistent with memory processes at 
      play in procedural learning.

TI  - A comparison of rectal and oral cultivable microbiota in wild and captive black
      lion tamarins (Leontopithecus chrysopygus, Mikan 1823).
PG  - e23370
LID - 10.1002/ajp.23370 [doi]
AB  - The black lion tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysopygus) is an endangered primate
      species, restricted to the Atlantic Forest fragments of Sao Paulo state, Brazil, 
      with an estimated wild population of ~1600 individuals. Integrative studies
      between zoo (ex situ) and wild (in situ) animals are crucial to modern
      conservation programs. They can demonstrate a substantial impact with the One
      Health concept, an interdisciplinary research frontier regarding the relations
      between human, animal, and environmental health. Studies of wild populations of
      Leontopithecus spp. are scarce and should be encouraged to provide baseline
      information to develop preventive and curative medicine in zoos and other
      conservation programs. Studying these animals in the wild can offer important
      reference parameters for the species. Comparing bacterial communities between in 
      situ and ex situ populations can help us understand both conditions and the
      dynamics of potentially pathogenic microorganisms. To increase our understanding 
      of resident microorganisms among these groups, we collected oral and rectal
      samples from captive (zoo) and wild black lion tamarins. We employed a culture
      method for the identification of aerobic bacteria. Thirty-three specimens were
      sampled (24 zoo and 8 wild animals) and 18 bacterial genera were identified. We
      found primarily Gram-positive bacteria in wild animals, whereas in zoo animals,
      Gram-negative bacteria were dominant. Some of the bacterial species we identified
      are potentially pathogenic, whereas several others are being reported here for
      the first time in this host species. Our results reinforce the importance of
      integrative studies for the future management and conservation of this endangered
      primate species.

TI  - HCV cure: an appropriate moment to reduce cannabis use in people living with HIV?
      (ANRS CO13 HEPAVIH data).
PG  - 15
LID - 10.1186/s12981-022-00440-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Thanks to direct-acting antivirals, hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection
      can be cured, with similar rates in HCV-infected and HIV-HCV co-infected
      patients. HCV cure is likely to foster behavioral changes in psychoactive
      substance use, which is highly prevalent in people living with HIV (PLWH).
      Cannabis is one substance that is very commonly used by PLWH, sometimes for
      therapeutic purposes. We aimed to identify correlates of cannabis use reduction
      following HCV cure in HIV-HCV co-infected cannabis users and to characterize
      persons who reduced their use. METHODS: We used data collected on HCV-cured
      cannabis users in a cross-sectional survey nested in the ANRS CO13 HEPAVIH cohort
      of HIV-HCV co-infected patients, to perform logistic regression, with post-HCV
      cure cannabis reduction as the outcome, and socio-behavioral characteristics as
      potential correlates. We also characterized the study sample by comparing
      post-cure substance use behaviors between those who reduced their cannabis use
      and those who did not. RESULTS: Among 140 HIV-infected cannabis users, 50 and 5
      had reduced and increased their use, respectively, while 85 had not changed their
      use since HCV cure. Cannabis use reduction was significantly associated with
      tobacco use reduction, a decrease in fatigue level, paying more attention to
      one's dietary habits since HCV cure, and pre-HCV cure alcohol abstinence (p =
      0.063 for alcohol use reduction). CONCLUSIONS: Among PLWH using cannabis,
      post-HCV cure cannabis reduction was associated with tobacco use reduction,
      improved well-being, and adoption of healthy behaviors. The management of
      addictive behaviors should therefore be encouraged during HCV treatment.

AB  - Introduction: the on-going COVID-19 pandemic caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus has
      imposed serious public health and economic threats on the entire world
      population. The SARS-CoV-2 has been identified from both domestic and wild
      animals constituting a threat to humans since most apparently healthy animals may
      potentially infect and cause the disease in humans, especially Animal Health
      Professionals (AHPs) who come directly in contact with animals. These
      professionals such as veterinarians play important roles among the One Health
      team in controlling the pandemic. This survey was conducted to assess the
      knowledge, risk perception, and prevention behaviors of AHPs in Nigeria who are
      important personnel in the control of emerging and re-emerging zoonotic and
      infectious diseases. Methods: an online-based epidemiological cross-sectional
      pre-tested questionnaire survey was carried out from April to May 2020. A total
      of 427 AHPs joined this survey. Descriptive statistics, chi-square test, and
      binary logistic regression model were used to analyze the data collected.
      Results: the respondents have a mean knowledge score of 7.34 +/- 2.05 (from a
      total possible score of 11) with the majority (66.7%, n = 285) having
      satisfactory knowledge scores on COVID-19. A high proportion (240/353) of
      respondents reported bats to be the major wildlife incriminated in the
      transmission of the COVID-19 virus though other animals reported were tiger,
      monkey, lion, and pangolin. At least, a quarter 131 (30.7%) of respondents
      perceived that visiting live animal markets is of high zoonotic risk to the
      spread of coronavirus. Most respondents reported hands washing and sanitizing
      after handling animals, and using personal protective equipment when handling
      suspected animals. At p<0.05; respondents' age, marital status, professional
      status, and geopolitical zone were significantly linked with satisfactory
      knowledge. Veterinarians (OR=0.40; 95%CI: 0.22-0.75) were thrice less likely to
      possess unsatisfactory knowledge of COVID-19 than laboratory technologists.
      Conclusion: participants in this survey have a satisfactory level of COVID-19
      knowledge and good mitigation measures instituted while working at their
      stations. However, AHPs need more enlightenment about the various zoonotic risk
      pathway contributing to the transmission of COVID-19.

AB  - Photoreceptor cell transplantation into the mouse retina has been shown to result
      in the transfer of cytoplasmic material between donor and host photoreceptors.
      Recently it has been found that this inter-photoreceptor material transfer
      process is likely to be mediated by nanotube-like structures connecting donor and
      host photoreceptors. By leveraging cone-specific reporter mice and
      super-resolution microscopy we provide evidence for the transfer of cytoplasmic
      material also from endogenous cones to endogenous rod photoreceptors and the
      existence of nanotube-like cell-cell connections possibly mediating this process 
      in the adult mouse retina, together with preliminary data indicating that
      horizontal material transfer may also occur in the human retina.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare standard and total corneal astigmatism measurements to the
      predicted pseudophakic (nontoric) refractive astigmatism in candidates for
      cataract surgery. DESIGN: A retrospective, cross-sectional study. METHODS: A
      single-center analysis of consecutive eyes measured with a swept-source optical
      coherence tomography biometer at a large tertiary medical center between February
      2018 and June 2020. Corneal astigmatism was calculated based on standard
      keratometry astigmatism (KA), total corneal astigmatism (TCA), and predicted
      refractive astigmatism (PRA) for a monofocal nontoric intraocular lens (IOL)
      implantation calculated by the Barrett toric calculator using the predicted
      posterior corneal astigmatism (PRA(Predicted-PCA)) and the measured posterior
      corneal astigmatism (PRA(Measured-PCA)) options. Separate analyses were performed
      for each eye. SETTING: Ophthalmology Department, Shaare Zedek Medical Center,
      Jerusalem, Israel. RESULTS: In total, 8152 eyes of 5320 patients (4221 right eyes
      [OD] and 3931 left eyes [OS], mean age 70.6+/-12.2 years, 54.2% females) were
      included in the study. The mean vector values (centroid) for KA, TCA,
      PRA(Predicted-PCA), and PRA(Measured-PCA) were 0.07 diopters [D] at 19.5 degrees 
      , 0.27 D at 7.5 degrees , 0.44 D at 2.9 degrees , and 0.43 D at 179.3 degrees ,
      respectively (P < .01), for OD and 0.02 D at 150.3 degrees , 0.23 D at 169.7
      degrees , 0.40 D at 179.4 degrees , and 0.42 D at 169.5 degrees , respectively (P
      < .01), for OS. More than 73% of eyes had a PRA >0.5 D. CONCLUSIONS: Standard and
      total corneal astigmatism measurements differ significantly from the PRA by the
      Barrett toric calculator. The PRA, rather than the KA or TCA, should be used as
      the reference guide for astigmatism correction with toric IOL implantation.

TI  - Two for one: targeting BCMA and CD19 in B-cell malignancies with off-the-shelf
      dual-CAR NK-92 cells.
PG  - 124
LID - 10.1186/s12967-022-03326-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has proven to be a
      valuable new treatment option for patients with B-cell malignancies. However, by 
      applying selective pressure, outgrowth of antigen-negative tumor cells can occur,
      eventually resulting in relapse. Subsequent rescue by administration of CAR-T
      cells with different antigen-specificity indicates that those tumor cells are
      still sensitive to CAR-T treatment and points towards a multi-target strategy.
      Due to their natural tumor sensitivity and highly cytotoxic nature, natural
      killer (NK) cells are a compelling alternative to T cells, especially considering
      the availability of an off-the-shelf unlimited supply in the form of the
      clinically validated NK-92 cell line. METHODS: Given our goal to develop a
      flexible system whereby the CAR expression repertoire of the effector cells can
      be rapidly adapted to the changing antigen expression profile of the target
      cells, electrotransfection with CD19-/BCMA-CAR mRNA was chosen as CAR loading
      method in this study. We evaluated the functionality of mRNA-engineered dual-CAR 
      NK-92 against tumor B-cell lines and primary patient samples. In order to test
      the clinical applicability of the proposed cell therapy product, the effect of
      irradiation on the proliferative rate and functionality of dual-CAR NK-92 cells
      was investigated. RESULTS: Co-electroporation of CD19 and BMCA CAR mRNA was
      highly efficient, resulting in 88.1% dual-CAR NK-92 cells. In terms of CD107a
      degranulation, and secretion of interferon (IFN)-gamma and granzyme B, dual-CAR
      NK-92 significantly outperformed single-CAR NK-92. More importantly, the killing 
      capacity of dual-CAR NK-92 exceeded 60% of single and dual antigen-expressing
      cell lines, as well as primary tumor cells, in a 4h co-culture assay at low
      effector to target ratios, matching that of single-CAR counterparts. Furthermore,
      our results confirm that dual-CAR NK-92 irradiated with 10 Gy cease to
      proliferate and are gradually cleared while maintaining their killing capacity.
      CONCLUSIONS: Here, using the clinically validated NK-92 cell line as a
      therapeutic cell source, we established a readily accessible and flexible
      platform for the generation of highly functional dual-targeted CAR-NK cells.

AB  - Surra is an infectious disease caused by Trypanosoma evansi, which affects a
      large number of domestic and wild animal species. Infection control is based on
      rapid diagnosis followed by treatment of sick animals. This study aimed to
      evaluate a buffered T. evansi antigen and rapid serum agglutination test (BA/Te) 
      for the detection of anti-T. evansi antibodies in serum samples of horses. For
      this purpose, 445 serum samples from horses were evaluated and the results
      compared with the diagnosis by CATT/T. evansi. Our data show a sensitivity of
      92%, specificity of 91% and a degree of agreement kappa (kappa) of 0.82 (95% CI: 
      0.771-0.877, P<0.01) between BA/Te and CATT/T. evansi. Antigen specificity was
      also evaluated against reactive serum for other infectious agents circulating in 
      equine herds. In conclusion, our findings show that BA/Te has the potential to be
      a practical and quick screening method for the detection of anti-T. evansi
      antibodies in horses.

TI  - High rates of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus among patients with active
      tuberculosis in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
PG  - 100306
LID - 10.1016/j.jctube.2022.100306 [doi]
AB  - Background: Tuberculosis (TB) and diabetes mellitus (DM) have negative
      synergistic impact on each other. Global guidelines recommend collaborative
      efforts to address this synergy, but implementation has been slow. Part of the
      reason is lack of adequate evidence on the operational feasibility of existing
      tools and mechanisms of collaboration. The objective of this study was to assess 
      the yield of DM screening among TB patients using risk scoring tools combined
      with blood tests as a feasible strategy for early detection to improve TB/DM
      treatment outcomes. Methods: Between September 2020 and December 2021, we
      conducted a cross-sectional study among patients receiving TB treatment in public
      health facilities in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia. Trained health workers collected data
      on symptoms and risk scoring checklists before testing for random and fasting
      blood glucose levels. We used logistic regression analyses techniques to
      determine factors associated with increased DM detection. A receiver-operating
      characteristic curve was constructed to determine the performance of the risk
      scoring checklist. Results: Of 2381 TB patients screened, 197 (8.3%) had DM of
      which 48.7% were newly diagnosed. Having a family history of DM predicted DM with
      Odds Ratio (OR) of 5.36 (95% Confidence Interval, [3.67, 7.83]) followed by age
      >/= 45 years (OR = 4.64, [3.18, 6.76]). Having one or more "symptoms" of DM was a
      significant predictor (OR 2.88, 95% CI, 2.06-4.01). Combining risk scores with
      symptoms predicted DM diagnosis with sensitivity of 94.7%, but specificity was
      low at 29.4%. In patients with known treatment outcome status, death rate was
      high. Conclusions: Almost a half of TB patients with DM did not know their
      status. A simple tool that combined risk factors with symptoms accurately
      predicted a subsequent diagnosis of DM. Such tools can help avoid high rates of
      death among TB patients suffering from DM through early detection.

TI  - Modeling Discontinuous Cultural Evolution: The Impact of Cross-Domain Transfer.
PG  - 786072
LID - 10.3389/fpsyg.2022.786072 [doi]
AB  - This paper uses autocatalytic networks to model discontinuous cultural
      transitions involving cross-domain transfer, using as an illustrative example,
      artworks inspired by the oldest-known uncontested example of figurative art: the 
      carving of the Hohlenstein-Stadel Lowenmensch, or lion-human. Autocatalytic
      networks provide a general modeling setting in which nodes are not just passive
      transmitters of activation; they actively galvanize, or "catalyze" the synthesis 
      of novel ("foodset-derived") nodes from existing ones (the "foodset.") This makes
      them uniquely suited to model how new structure grows out of earlier structure,
      i.e., cumulative, generative network growth. They have been used to model the
      origin and early evolution of biological life, and the emergence of cognitive
      structures capable of undergoing cultural evolution. We conducted a study in
      which six individual creators and one group generated music, prose, poetry, and
      visual art inspired by the Hohlenstein-Stadel Lowenmensch, and answered questions
      about the process. The data revealed four through-lines by which they expressed
      the Lowenmensch in an alternative art form: (1) lion-human hybrid, (2)
      subtracting from the whole to reveal the form within, (3) deterioration, and (4) 
      waiting to be found with a story to tell. Autocatalytic networks were used to
      model how these four spontaneously derived through-lines form a cultural lineage 
      from Lowenmensch to artist to audience. We used the resulting data from three
      creators to model the cross-domain transfer from inspirational source (sculpted
      figurine) to creative product (music, poetry, prose, visual art). These four
      spontaneously-generated threads of cultural continuity formed the backbone of
      this Lowenmensch-inspired cultural lineage, enabling culture to evolve even in
      the face of discontinuity at the level conventional categories or domains. We
      know of no other theory of cultural evolution that accommodates cross-domain
      transfer or other forms of discontinuity. The approach paves the way for a broad 
      scientific framework for the origins of evolutionary processes.

TI  - Total Mercury, Total Selenium, and Monomethylmercury Relationships in Multiple
      Age Cohorts and Tissues of Steller Sea Lions (Eumetopias jubatus).
PG  - 1477-1489
LID - 10.1002/etc.5329 [doi]
AB  - Steller sea lion (Eumetopias jubatus) tissue mercury concentrations increasingly 
      above thresholds of concern occur in regions of Alaska where lack of population
      recovery is noted. Selenium-monomethylmercury interactions may mitigate toxicosis
      but may also result in functional selenium deficiency, impacting essential
      selenium-dependent processes. Physiologically driven differences in tissue
      concentrations (organotropism) of total mercury ([THg]), total selenium ([TSe]), 
      and monomethylmercury ([MeHg(+) ]) confound interpretation for various age
      cohorts. Archived tissues from Alaska Steller sea lions (2002-2016) were used to 
      compare [THg], [MeHg(+) ], and [TSe] across age cohorts and tissue types. Liver
      [THg] ranged from 0.05 to 63.7 microg/g. Fetal and pup livers had significantly
      lower [THg] and [TSe], higher percentage MeHg(+) , and greater range of molar
      TSe:THg than subadult and adult livers. Molar Se:MeHg(+) ratios, including Se in 
      excess of nonmethylmercury, were dependent on [MeHg(+) ] in fetuses and pups.
      While [THg] varied significantly by muscle type (heart vs. skeletal) and
      anatomical location, concentrations were strongly correlated. Biomagnification
      and/or bioaccumulation of THg in liver of older animals confounded comparison
      with other tissues; however, in fetal and pup liver [THg] correlated with other
      tissues. In contrast, liver [MeHg(+) ] correlated with other tissues across all
      age classes. Fetal and pup tissues, which reflect in utero exposure and are
      subject to limited bioaccumulation, are ideal for assessing mercury exposure
      related to dam diet, including intertissue comparison, and represent key cohorts 
      of concern. Evaluating [MeHg(+) ] and [TSe] in tissues from multiple age cohorts 
      allows better intertissue comparison, providing insight into time courses, routes
      of exposure, and potential for adverse effects. Environ Toxicol Chem

AB  - Type 2 idiopathic macular telangiectasia (MacTel-2) is a progressive adult-onset 
      macular disease associated with bilateral perifoveal vascular changes, Muller
      cell degeneration and increased blood-retinal barrier permeability. The
      pathophysiological mechanisms of MacTel-2 remain unclear, however it was
      previously reported that anti-retinal antibodies in MacTel-2 patients are a
      significant feature of the disease. In this study, we aimed to compare the
      prevalence of anti-retinal antibodies in patients MacTel-2, healthy controls and 
      patients with other retinal diseases. MacTel-2 patients diagnosed with multimodal
      imaging were enrolled and their disease severities were graded using
      spectral-domain optical coherence tomography. For comparison, patients with
      age-related macular degeneration (AMD), inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) or no
      retinal disease (healthy controls) were recruited as controls. Blood serum
      samples were screened for immunoglobulin G anti-retinal antibodies by western
      blotting, followed by densitometry analysis. Odds ratios (OR) with 95% confidence
      intervals (CI) were calculated and p < 0.05 considered statistically significant.
      Overall, anti-retinal antibody-positive cases were older (64 +/- 15 vs 53 +/- 17 
      years, p < 0.001) and females were more likely to develop anti-retinal antibodies
      (OR: 2.41, CI: 1.12-5.18). The frequency of anti-retinal antibody detection in
      MacTel-2 patients (n = 42, 36%) was not significantly different from healthy
      controls (n = 52, 25%) or IRD patients (n = 18, 25%) and the majority of MacTel-2
      patients had no anti-retinal antibodies. In contrast, the frequency of
      anti-retinal antibody detection was significantly higher in patients with AMD (n 
      = 15, 73%, p < 0.001). The lack of a greater anti-retinal antibody frequency or
      specificity in the MacTel-2 cohort suggests that antibody mediated immunological 
      mechanisms may play a less significant role in MacTel-2 disease pathogenesis.

AB  - ABSTRACT: Ophthalmologists find management of neurotrophic keratopathy (NK)
      challenging because conventional therapy lacks efficacy and may result in
      permanent loss of vision. Recombinant nerve growth factor (cenegermin) targets
      the underlying pathogenesis of NK by regenerating corneal nerves and healing the 
      corneal epithelium through promotion of proliferation, maturing corneal
      epithelial cells. It has been approved as Food Drug Association-approved
      treatment of NK. In this article, the background, clinical trials, and impact of 
      recombinant nerve growth factor as the first neurotrophic factor for the
      restoration of corneal integrity, homeostasis, and corneal nerve regeneration are
      discussed.

TI  - Dispensing care?: The dosette box and the status of low-fi technologies within
      older people's end-of-life caregiving practices.
PG  - 745-763
LID - 10.1111/1467-9566.13455 [doi]
AB  - Technology has been lauded as a solution to range of challenges presented by
      ageing population internationally. While the lion-share of scholarship has
      focussed on high-fi, digital technologies, there has been a recent shift to
      exploring the contributions mundane, low-fi technologies make to older people's
      daily lives and our understandings of health, illness and care more broadly.
      Drawing from serial narrative interview data collected with 19 married couples
      aged 70 and over living in the U.K., this article explores the way one medical
      technology-the dosette box-was taken-up and deployed in their end-of-life caring 
      process. Informed by actor-network theory and critical feminist scholarship, this
      article considers how the dosette box played an active role in structuring
      relationships, scheduling daily care activities and enforcing medical compliance.
      In doing so, we suggest that the dosette box provided an unexpected companion and
      'weapon of the weak' for older partner's attempting to assert their expertise and
      power while caring. We also explore how the dosette box demanded an even higher
      level of regular, vital care from older partner's once introduced into the home, 
      thus entrenching the physical and emotional demands of dispensing care.

TI  - Sleep and eye disease: A review.
PG  - 334-344
LID - 10.1111/ceo.14071 [doi]
AB  - There is a growing body of literature on the effects of sleep disorders, in
      particular obstructive sleep apnoea (OSA), on ocular health, with consistent
      evidence of an increased risk of floppy eyelid syndrome, non-arteritic anterior
      ischaemic optic neuropathy, diabetic macular oedema, and other retinal
      vasculature changes in individuals with OSA. However, reports on OSA's
      associations with glaucoma, papilloedema, diabetic retinopathy, central serous
      chorioretinopathy, and keratoconus have been conflicting, while links between OSA
      and age-related macular degeneration have only been described fairly recently.
      Despite numerous suggestions that OSA treatment may reduce risk of these eye
      diseases, well-designed studies to support these claims are lacking. In
      particular, the ocular hypertensive effects of continuous positive airway
      pressure (CPAP) therapy for OSA requires further investigation into its potential
      impact on glaucoma risk and management. Reports of ocular surface complications
      secondary to leaking CPAP masks highlights the importance of ensuring good mask
      fit. Poor sleep habits have also been linked with increased myopia risk; however,
      the evidence on this association remains weak.

TI  - Lions in a coexistence landscape: Repurposing a traditional field technique to
      monitor an elusive carnivore.
PG  - e8662
LID - 10.1002/ece3.8662 [doi]
AB  - Throughout Africa, lions are thought to have experienced dramatic population
      decline and range contraction. The greatest declines are likely occurring in
      human-dominated landscapes where reliably estimating lion populations is
      particularly challenging. By adapting a method that has thus far only been
      applied to animals that are habituated to vehicles, we estimate lion density in
      two community areas in Kenya's South Rift, located more than 100 km from the
      nearest protected area (PA). More specifically, we conducted an 89-day survey
      using unstructured spatial sampling coupled with playbacks, a commonly used field
      technique, and estimated lion density using spatial capture-recapture (SCR)
      models. Our estimated density of 5.9 lions over the age of 1 year per 100 km(2)
      compares favorably with many PAs and suggests that this is a key lion population 
      that could be crucial for connectivity across the wider landscape. We discuss the
      possible mechanisms supporting this density and demonstrate how rigorous field
      methods combined with robust analyses can produce reliable population estimates
      within human-dominated landscapes.

AB  - The present report provides data on entanglement of Steller sea lions (SSL) in
      marine debris on Tyuleniy Island, Sea of Okhotsk. The frequency of entanglement
      depending on the material, sex, and age of animals was estimated. A total of 133 
      SSL were recorded as having debris on their bodies, or an average of 22.2
      individuals per year. The relative rate of entanglement over the observation
      years ranged from 1.48 to 1.97% of their total number. The entangled individuals 
      were both males and females of all ages, but young males constituted the largest 
      proportion among them (5.2%). The entangled SSL most frequently (43.2%) had neck 
      collars (the material is not defined) and, less frequently, packaging bands
      (23.4%), nets (17.7%), and other debris. Most of marine litter found on SSL is
      associated with commercial fishing activities. On Tyuleniy Island, the rate of
      SSL entanglement is higher than in the eastern part of the species' range.

AB  - On their way to the oocyte, sperm cells are subjected to oxidative stress, which 
      may trigger the oxidation of phospholipids (PL). Applying MALDI-TOF MS, HPTLC and
      ESI-IT MS, we comparatively analyzed the PL compositions of semen and blood of
      species differing in their reproductive systems and types of nutrition (bull,
      boar, stallion, lion and man) with regard to the sensitivity to oxidation as well
      as the accumulation of harmful lyso-PL (LPL), transient products of lipid
      oxidation. In addition, the protective capacity of seminal fluid (SF) was also
      examined. The PL composition of erythrocytes and blood plasma is similar across
      the species, while pronounced differences exist for sperm and SF. Since the blood
      function is largely conserved across mammalian species, but the reproductive
      systems may vary in many aspects, the obtained results suggest that the PL
      composition is not determined by the type of nutrition, but by the relatedness of
      species and by functional requirements of cell membranes such as fluidity. Sperm 
      motion and fertilization of oocytes require a rather flexible membrane, which is 
      accomplished by significant moieties of unsaturated fatty acyl residues in sperm 
      lipids of most species, but implies a higher risk of oxidation. Due to a high
      content of plasmalogens (alkenyl ether lipids), bull sperm are most susceptible
      to oxidation. Our data indicate that bull sperm possess the most effective
      protective power in SF. Obviously, a co-evolution of PL composition and
      protective mechanisms has occurred in semen and is related to the reproductive
      characteristics. Although the protective capacity in human SF seems well
      developed, we recorded the most pronounced individual contaminations with LPL in 
      human semen. Probably, massive oxidative challenges related to lifestyle factors 
      interfere with natural conditions.

TI  - Effect of small extracellular vesicles derived from IL-10-overexpressing
      mesenchymal stem cells on experimental autoimmune uveitis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Autoimmune uveitis is a sight-threatening intraocular inflammation
      mainly caused by immune dysregulation. The development of safe and effective
      therapeutic approaches is urgently needed. Small extracellular vesicles (sEVs)
      derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) have been demonstrated to inhibit
      autoimmune responses; however, the immunosuppressive effect of MSC-sEVs is too
      weak for clinical transfer. In the current study, we investigated the therapeutic
      effect of IL-10-overexpressing MSC-sEVs (sEV-IL10) on experimental autoimmune
      uveitis (EAU) and studied the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Mice were randomly
      grouped and received a single tail vein injection of different sEVs (50 mug) or
      PBS on day 11 post-immunization. The clinical and histological scores were
      graded, and the percentage of T helper cell was measured. To investigate the
      effect of sEVs on the proliferation of T-cells and the differentiation of Th1,
      Th17 and Treg cells, T-cells were cocultured with sEVs under the corresponding
      culture conditions. After labeled with PKH-26, sEVs were traced both in vivo and 
      in vitro. RESULTS: Compared with normal or vector sEV-treated groups, mice in the
      sEV-IL10-treated group had lower clinical and histological scores with lower
      percentages of Th1 and Th17 cells in the eyes and higher percentages of Treg
      cells in the spleen and draining lymph nodes (LN). Furthermore, sEV-IL10 enhanced
      the suppressive effect of MSC-sEVs on the proliferation of T-cells and
      differentiation of Th1 and Th17 cells, whereas upregulated the differentiation of
      Treg cells. Both in vivo and in vitro experiments demonstrated that MSC-sEVs were
      rapidly enriched in target tissues and internalized by T-cells. CONCLUSION: These
      results suggested that sEV-IL10 effectively ameliorates EAU by regulating the
      proliferation and differentiation of T-cells, indicating sEVs as a potential
      novel therapy for autoimmune uveitis or other autoimmune diseases.

AB  - This study investigated the pathogenesis of age-related macular degeneration
      (AMD) using histological methods that are commonly used for atherosclerotic
      vascular disease (ASVD). 1 normal, 3 early dry AMD, and 1 late dry AMD eyes were 
      obtained from the Lions Eye Bank of Oregon and systematically dissected. They
      were stained with hematoxylin and eosin, Oil red O, Masson, Elastica van Gieson, 
      Alizarin red, and Prussian blue. Additionally, the normal and late dry AMD eyes
      were immunostained for a-smooth muscle actin, CD45, and CD68 with Nile red and
      DAPI. Correlations were found between severity of AMD and lipid accumulation in
      the deep sclera (+), numbers of drusen between the Bruch's membrane and retinal
      pigment epithelium (RPE) (+), amount of collagen in the deep sclera (+), and
      amount of elastin in the deep sclera (-) (P < 0.1). Geographic atrophy, RPE
      detachment, and abnormal capillary shape and distribution in the choriocapillaris
      were observed in the fovea of late AMD. There were no stenosis, plaque,
      hemorrhage, and calcification. Additionally, late AMD tended to have higher
      smooth muscle thicknesses of the choroidal vascular walls, lower numbers of T
      lymphocytes in the choroid, and higher numbers of macrophages near the RPE and in
      the choroid relative to normal (P < 0.1). Macrophages-derived foam cells were
      detected near the Bruch's membrane in late AMD. Therefore, the present study
      showed many histological characteristics of ASVD in AMD, which suggests an
      association between them; however, there were also some histological
      characteristics of ASVD that were not found in AMD, which indicates that there
      exist pathogenic differences between them. The results generally support the
      vascular model of AMD, but some details still need clarification.

TI  - Anti-Tumor Potency of Short-Term Interleukin-15 Dendritic Cells Is Potentiated by
      In Situ Silencing of Programmed-Death Ligands.
PG  - 734256
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2022.734256 [doi]
AB  - Dendritic cell (DC) vaccines have proven to be a valuable tool in cancer immune
      therapy. With several DC vaccines being currently tested in clinical trials,
      knowledge about their therapeutic value has been significantly increased in the
      past decade. Despite their established safety, it has become clear that objective
      clinical responses are not yet robust enough, requiring further optimization.
      Improvements of this advanced therapy medicinal product encompass, among others, 
      regulating their immune stimulating capacity by in situ gene engineering, in
      addition to their implementation in combination therapy regimens. Previously, we 
      have reported on a superior monocyte-derived DC preparation, including
      interleukin-15, pro-inflammatory cytokines and immunological danger signals in
      the culture process. These so-called IL-15 DCs have already proven to exhibit
      several favorable properties as cancer vaccine. Evolving research into mechanisms
      that could further modulate the immune response towards cancer, points to
      programmed death-1 as an important player that dampens anti-tumor immunity.
      Aiming at leveraging the immunogenicity of DC vaccines, we hypothesized that
      additional implementation of the inhibitory immune checkpoint molecules
      programmed death-ligand (PD-L)1 and PD-L2 in IL-15 DC vaccines would exhibit
      superior stimulatory potential. In this paper, we successfully implemented PD-L
      silencing at the monocyte stage in the 3-day IL-15 DC culture protocol resulting 
      in substantial downregulation of both PD-L1 and PD-L2 to levels below 30%.
      Additionally, we validated that these DCs retain their specific characteristics, 
      both at the level of phenotype and interferon gamma secretion. Evaluating their
      functional characteristics, we demonstrate that PD-L silencing does not affect
      the capacity to induce allogeneic proliferation. Ultimately designed to induce a 
      durable tumor antigen-specific immune response, PD-L silenced IL-15 DCs were
      capable of surpassing PD-1-mediated inhibition by antigen-specific T cells.
      Further corroborating the superior potency of short-term IL-15 DCs, the
      combination of immune stimulatory components during DC differentiation and
      maturation with in situ checkpoint inhibition supports further clinical
      translation.

      submitted to the Possover-LION procedure for bilateral neuromodulation of
      femoral, sciatic, and pudendal nerves. Assessments were performed before the
      surgical procedure and at 3, 6, and 12 months postoperatively. The primary
      outcome was evolution in walking, measured by the Walking Index for Spinal Cord
      Injury score, preoperatively and at 12 months. Secondary outcomes were changes in
      overall mobility (Mobility Assessment Tool for Evaluation of Rehabilitation
      score), urinary function and quality of life (Qualiveen questionnaire), and bowel
      (time for bowel emptying proceedings and Wexner's Fecal Incontinence Severity
      Index [FISI]) and sexual functions (International Index of Erectile Function for 
      men and Female Sexual Function Index for women). Surgical time, intraoperative
      bleeding, and perioperative complications were also recorded. RESULTS:
      Qualitatively, 18 of 25 (72%) patients with thoracic injury and 3 of 5 (60%)
      patients with cervical injury managed to establish a walker-assisted gait at
      one-year follow-up (p < 0.0001). A total of 11 (47.8%) have improved in their
      urinary incontinence (p < 0.0001), and seven (30.4%) improved their enuresis (p =
      0.0156). The FISI improved from a median of 9 points preoperatively to 5.5 at 12 
      months (p = 0.0056). Of note, 20 of 28 (71.4%) patients reported an improvement
      on genital sensitivity at 12 months postoperatively (p < 0.0001), but this was
      not reflected in sexual quality-of-life questionnaires. CONCLUSIONS: Patients
      experienced improved mobility and genital sensitivity and a reduction in the
      number of urinary and fecal incontinence episodes. By demonstrating reproducible 
      outcomes and safety, this study helps establish the Possover-LION procedure as an
      addition to the therapeutic armamentarium for the rehabilitation of patients with
      chronic SCI. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: This study was registered at the WHO
      Clinical Trials Database through the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials-REBEC 
      (Universal Tracking Number: U1111-1261-4428).

AB  - Understanding the ability of animals to cope with a changing environment is
      critical in a world affected by anthropogenic disturbance.(1) Individual foraging
      strategies may influence the coping ability of entire populations, as these
      strategies can be adapted to contrasting conditions, allowing populations with
      foraging polymorphisms to be more resilient toward environmental change.(2)(,)(3)
      However, environmentally dependent fitness consequences of individual foraging
      strategies and their effects on population dynamics have not been conclusively
      documented.(4)(,)(5) Here, we use biologging data from endangered Galapagos sea
      lion females (Zalophus wollebaeki) to show that benthically foraging individuals 
      dig after sand-dwelling prey species while pelagic foragers hunt in more open
      waters. These specialized foraging behaviors result in distinct and temporally
      stable patterns of vibrissae abrasion. Using vibrissae length as a visual marker 
      for the benthic versus pelagic foraging strategies, we furthermore uncovered an
      environment-dependent fitness trade-off between benthic and pelagic foragers,
      suggesting that the foraging polymorphism could help to buffer the population
      against the negative effects of climate change. However, demographic projections 
      suggest that this buffering effect is unlikely to be sufficient to reverse the
      ongoing population decline of the past four decades.(6) Our study shows how
      crucial a deeper understanding of behavioral polymorphisms can be for predicting 
      how populations cope within a rapidly changing world. VIDEO ABSTRACT.

      treatment in New Zealand sea lion (Phocarctos hookeri) pups.

AB  - Hypervirulent Klebsiella pneumoniae infection causes significant mortality of
      endangered New Zealand sea lion pups at Enderby Island, Auckland Islands. Gross
      necropsy and histopathology findings are well reported, but little is known about
      the clinical course of disease in affected pups. To determine factors feasible as
      clinical screening tools for hypervirulent K. pneumoniae in live pups, 150 pups
      over two field seasons (2016-18) were recruited shortly after birth for a
      prospective cohort study. A randomised controlled clinical treatment trial with
      the anthelmintic ivermectin was conducted concurrently and risk factor data and
      biological samples were collected approximately fortnightly. Treatment with
      ivermectin has been demonstrated to reduce the risk of hypervirulent K.
      pneumoniae mortality in pups, so effects on clinical parameters between the
      treated and control cohorts were also investigated. A broader sample of pups were
      monitored for clinical signs to investigate the course of disease in affected
      pups. Clinical signs, haematology and oral and rectal swabs to detect
      gastrointestinal carriage of hypervirulent K. pneumoniae were not useful for
      detection of disease prior to death. Of those pups that died due to hypervirulent
      K. pneumoniae, only 26.1% (18/69) had any clinical signs prior, likely a
      reflection of the peracute course of disease. On comparison of haematological
      parameters between ivermectin-treated and control pups, significantly lower total
      plasma protein and higher eosinophil counts were seen in control versus treated
      pups, however standard length as a surrogate for age was a more important
      influence on parameters overall than ivermectin treatment. This study also
      highlighted a cohort of pups with severe clinical signs suggestive of
      hypervirulent K. pneumoniae infection were lost to follow up at the end of the
      monitored season, which could be contributing to cryptic juvenile mortality.

      dhakensis isolated from sea lion (Zalophus californianus).
PG  - 932-940

AB  - Species of Aeromonas are ubiquitous pathogens of fish and aquatic animals and can
      infect humans and other animals through the food chain. However, there are few
      reports of marine mammalian infections. In 2020, a sea lion (Zalophus
      californianus) died acutely at an aquarium in Harbin, Heilongjiang Province,
      China. In order to explore the cause of death, we dissected the animal and
      observed pathological changes. Ogans were aseptically collected and used for
      bacterial isolation and culture. This revealed that the sea lion had died of
      sepsis caused by a bacterial infection. Isolated bacteria were investigated by
      morphology, biochemical phenotype and molecular identification, and this
      determined the pathogen as A. dhakensis. The isolate contained six virulence
      genes, hlyA, aerA, act, lafA, ela, fla, and was susceptible to most antibiotics. 
      This is the first report of A. dhakensis associated with septicaemia in pinnipeds
      and a description of its virulence and resistance profiles. Its presence in
      aquatic environments poses a potential threat to marine mammals.

      Including SARS-CoV-2 by Non-thermal Plasma.
PG  - 815393
LID - 10.3389/fbioe.2022.815393 [doi]
AB  - The current pandemic resulted in a rapidly increasing demand for personal
      protective equipment (PPE) initially leading to severe shortages of these items. 
      Hence, during an unexpected and fast virus spread, the possibility of reusing
      highly efficient protective equipment could provide a viable solution for keeping
      both healthcare professionals and the general public equipped and protected. This
      requires an efficient decontamination technique that preserves functionality of
      the sensitive materials used for PPE production. Non-thermal plasma (NTP) is a
      decontamination technique with documented efficiency against select bacterial and
      fungal pathogens combined with low damage to exposed materials. We have
      investigated NTP for decontamination of high-efficiency P3 R filters from viral
      respiratory pathogens in comparison to other commonly used techniques. We show
      that NTP treatment completely inactivates SARS-CoV-2 and three other common human
      respiratory viruses including Influenza A, Rhinovirus and Adenovirus, revealing
      an efficiency comparable to 90 degrees C dry heat or UVC light. Unlike some of
      the tested techniques (e.g., autoclaving), NTP neither influenced the filtering
      efficiency nor the microstructure of the filter. We demonstrate that NTP is a
      powerful and economic technology for efficient decontamination of protective
      filters and other sensitive materials from different respiratory pathogens.

TI  - Multi-population puma connectivity could restore genomic diversity to at-risk
      coastal populations in California.
PG  - 286-299

AB  - Urbanization is decreasing wildlife habitat and connectivity worldwide, including
      for apex predators, such as the puma (Puma concolor). Puma populations along
      California's central and southern coastal habitats have experienced rapid
      fragmentation from development, leading to calls for demographic and genetic
      management. To address urgent conservation genomic concerns, we used
      double-digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD) sequencing to analyze
      16,285 genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from 401 pumas sampled 
      broadly across the state. Our analyses indicated support for 4-10 geographically 
      nested, broad- to fine-scale genetic clusters. At the broadest scale, the four
      genetic clusters had high genetic diversity and exhibited low linkage
      disequilibrium, indicating that pumas have retained genomic diversity statewide. 
      However, multiple lines of evidence indicated substructure, including 10
      finer-scale genetic clusters, some of which exhibited fixed alleles and linkage
      disequilibrium. Fragmented populations along the Southern Coast and Central Coast
      had particularly low genetic diversity and strong linkage disequilibrium,
      indicating genetic drift and close inbreeding. Our results demonstrate that
      genetically at risk populations are typically nested within a broader-scale group
      of interconnected populations that collectively retain high genetic diversity and
      heterogenous fixations. Thus, extant variation at the broader scale has potential
      to restore diversity to local populations if management actions can enhance vital
      gene flow and recombine locally sequestered genetic diversity. These state- and
      genome-wide results are critically important for science-based conservation and
      management practices. Our nested population genomic analysis highlights the
      information that can be gained from population genomic studies aiming to provide 
      guidance for the conservation of fragmented populations.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ocular surface masqueraders encompass any ocular surface lesion
      masquerading as another ocular surface lesion. High resolution optical coherence 
      tomography (HR-OCT) has emerged as an adjunctive tool to clinical acumen. This
      study's purpose is to evaluate the utility of HR-OCT images in guiding the
      diagnosis and management of those lesions. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 22 individuals
      with a clinically ambiguous ocular surface lesion with slit lamp photographs
      (SLP), HR-OCT images, and histopathological examination were included in the
      study. The presumptive clinical diagnosis based on SLP was compared to the
      diagnosis suggested by HR-OCT findings and to definitive diagnosis by
      histopathology. The main outcome of this study was the frequency in which HR-OCT 
      findings guided the clinician to the correct diagnosis. RESULTS: 7 lesions were
      epithelial, 3 had an epithelial and a subepithelial component, and 12 were
      subepithelial. HR-OCT was most effective in discerning lesion location,
      successfully identifying the location in 100% of cases. Classic HR-OCT findings
      were detected in 68.2% of cases while suggestive features were detected in 31.8% 
      of cases. The epithelial lesions' mean epithelial thickness was 265.4 +/- 140.6
      mum, the subepithelial lesions' mean was 58.0 +/- 25.0 mum, and the combined
      lesions' mean was 140.0 +/- 70.0 mum. The epithelium was significantly thicker in
      epithelial lesions compared to subepithelial and combined lesions. By ROC
      analysis we identified that using a cut off of 156 mum, the sensitivity was 86%
      and the specificity was 93%. DISCUSSION: HR-OCT can be a valuable diagnostic
      tool, assisting in the differentiation of ambiguous ocular surface pathologies by
      providing a cross-sectional, morphological image of the lesion.

TI  - All Quality Improvement Is Health Equity Work: Designing Improvement to Reduce
      Disparities.
LID - e2020045948E [pii]
LID - 10.1542/peds.2020-045948E [doi]
AB  - Quality improvement (QI) can be a critical means by which to achieve equity in
      health and health care. QI efforts, however, often fail to be designed and
      implemented through the lens of health equity. In this article, we will discuss
      the current state of the intersection between QI and health equity, then lay out 
      specific steps researchers and practitioners can take to ensure that their QI
      work reduces, rather than increases or maintains, existing disparities. These
      steps include first, understanding existing disparities and, second, utilizing
      community engagement to ensure that QI enhances health equity. Before embarking
      on QI work, QI practitioners should first examine their metric of interest by
      patient characteristics, starting with race and ethnicity, language, and markers 
      of access to care and socioeconomic status. Developing an understanding of
      existing disparities relevant to the QI project will ensure that the QI
      interventions can be designed to be most effective in the disadvantaged
      populations, thus increasing the likelihood that the intervention reduces
      existing disparities. In designing QI interventions, practitioners must also plan
      engagement with stakeholder populations ahead of time, to carefully understand
      their needs and priorities and how best to address them through QI efforts.

TI  - Cats and dogs: A mesopredator navigating risk and reward provisioned by an apex
      predator.
PG  - e8641
LID - 10.1002/ece3.8641 [doi]
AB  - Successfully perceiving risk and reward is fundamental to the fitness of an
      animal, and can be achieved through a variety of perception tactics. For example,
      mesopredators may "directly" perceive risk by visually observing apex predators, 
      or may "indirectly" perceive risk by observing habitats used by predators. Direct
      assessments should more accurately characterize the arrangement of risk and
      reward; however, indirect assessments are used more frequently in studies
      concerning the response of GPS-marked animals to spatiotemporally variable
      sources of risk and reward. We investigated the response of a mesopredator to the
      presence of risk and reward created by an apex predator, where risk and reward
      likely vary in relative perceptibility (i.e., degree of being perceptible).
      First, we tested whether coyotes (Canis latrans) use direct or indirect
      assessments to navigate the presence of mountain lions (Puma concolor; risk) and 
      kills made by mountain lions (reward) in an area where coyotes were a common prey
      item for mountain lions. Second, we assessed the behavioral response of coyotes
      to direct encounters with mountain lions. Third, we evaluated spatiotemporal use 
      of carrion by coyotes at kills made by mountain lions. Indirect assessments
      generally outperformed direct assessments when integrating analyses into a
      unified framework; nevertheless, our ability to detect direct perception in
      navigating to mountain lion kills was likely restricted by scale and sampling
      limitations (e.g., collar fix rates, unsampled kill sites). Rather than
      responding to the risk of direct encounters with mountain lions, coyotes
      facilitated encounters by increasing their movement rate, and engaged in risky
      behavior by scavenging at mountain lion kills. Coyotes appear to mitigate risk by
      using indirect perception to avoid mountain lions. Our predator-predator
      interactions and insights are nuanced and counter to the conventional
      predator-prey systems that have generated much of the predation risk literature.

LID - 10.1007/s10586-022-03565-8 [doi]
AB  - In the modern healthcare system, the function of the Internet of Things (IoT) and
      the data mining methods with cloud computing plays an essential role in
      controlling a large number of big data for predicting and diagnosing various
      categories of diseases. However, when the patients suffer from more than one
      disease, the physician may not identify it properly. Therefore, in this research,
      the predictive method using the cloud with IoT-based database is proposed for
      forecasting the diseases that utilized the biosensors to estimate the constraints
      of patients. In addition, a novel Generalized Fuzzy Intelligence-based Ant Lion
      Optimization (GFIbALO) classifier along with a regression rule is proposed for
      predicting the diseases accurately. Initially, the dataset is filtered and
      feature extracted using the regression rule that data is processed on the
      proposed GFIbALO approach for classifying diseases. Moreover, suppose the patient
      has been affected by any diseases, in that case, the warning signal will be
      alerted to the patients via text or any other way, and the patients can get
      advice from doctors or any other medical support. The implementation of the
      proposed GFIbALO classifier is done with the use of the MATLAB tool.
      Subsequently, the results from the presented model are compared with state of the
      art techniques, and it shows that the presented method is more beneficial in
      diagnosis and disease forecast.

LID - 10.1089/mab.2021.0055 [doi]
AB  - Monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that specifically target podoplanin (PDPN), a marker
      for type I alveolar cells, are required for immunohistochemical analyses.
      Anti-PDPN mAbs are available for many species, including human, mouse, rat,
      rabbit, dog, cat, bovine, pig, Tasmanian devil, alpaca, tiger, whale, goat,
      horse, bear, sheep, and California sea lion PDPNs. However, no anti-Steller sea
      lion PDPN (stePDPN) antibody has been developed. Immunohistochemical analysis
      showed that an anti-California sea lion PDPN mAb (PMab-269) reacted with type I
      alveolar cells from the Steller sea lion lung, renal glomeruli and Bowman's
      capsules from kidney, and lymphatic endothelial cells from the colon, indicating 
      that PMab-269 is useful for detecting stePDPN.

AB  - UN member states have committed to achieving the Sustainable Development Goals
      (SDGs) by 2030. This Review examines the published evidence on how improving eye 
      health can contribute to advancing the SDGs (beyond SDG 3). We identified 29
      studies that showed direct benefits from providing eye health services on SDGs
      related to one or more of poverty (SDGs 1, 2, and 8), education (SDG 4), equality
      (SDGs 5 and 10), and sustainable cities (SDG 11). The eye health services
      included cataract surgery, free cataract screening, provision of spectacles,
      trichiasis surgery, rehabilitation services, and rural community eye health
      volunteers. These findings provide a comprehensive perspective on the direct
      links between eye health services and advancing the SDGs. In addition, eye health
      services likely have indirect effects on multiple SDGs, mediated through one of
      the direct effects. Finally, there are additional plausible links to other SDGs, 
      for which evidence has not yet been established.

AB  - Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the recognized gold standard for diagnostic
      imaging of the central nervous system in human and veterinary patients.
      Information on the use of this modality and possible imaging abnormalities in
      captive non-domestic felids is currently limited to individual case reports or
      small case series. This retrospective study provides information on technique and
      imaging findings in a cohort of cases undergoing MRI at an academic Veterinary
      Medical Center. The University of Tennessee College of Veterinary Medicine MRI
      database was searched for non-domestic felids undergoing MRI of the brain or
      spine from 2008 to 2021. Medical record data were recorded, and MRI studies were 
      reviewed. Fifty animals met the inclusion criteria. The most common brain
      diseases were Chiari-like malformation (n = 8) and inflammatory conditions (n =
      8). Other abnormalities included pituitary lesions (n = 5), brain atrophy (n =
      2), and one each of metabolic and traumatic conditions. Fourteen animals had a
      normal brain MRI study. The most common spinal abnormality was intervertebral
      disc disease (n = 7). Other disorders included vertebral dysplasia (n = 2),
      presumptive ischemic myelopathy (n = 1), subdural ossification causing spinal
      cord compression (n = 1), and multiple myeloma (n = 1). Spinal cord swelling of
      undetermined cause was suspected in two animals, and seven patients had a normal 
      MRI study of the spine. MRI is a valuable tool in the diagnostic workup of
      non-domestic felids with presumptive neurologic disease.

AB  - The benefit of imaging in the follow-up setting for high-risk melanoma patients
      is uncertain, and even less is known about the impact of intensive follow-up on
      the patient s quality of life. In 2017, a Swedish prospective randomized
      multicenter study started, in which high-risk melanoma patients are randomly
      assigned 1:1 to follow-up by physical examinations +/- whole-body imaging. The
      first-year examinations are scheduled at 0, 6 and 12 months. The aim of this
      study was to investigate whether the patients health-related quality of life
      (HRQoL) and levels of anxiety and depression were affected at 1 year by imaging. 
      Anxiety/depression and HRQoL were assessed at 0 and 12 months by the
      questionnaires Hospital Anxiety and Depression (HAD) scale and EORTC QLQ-C30
      version 3. Expected baseline QLQ-C30 values for the patients were calculated
      using data from the general population. In total, 204 patients were analyzed.
      Mean differences in subscale scores at 1 year were not statistically significant 
      either for HRQoL or for anxiety/depression. Baseline HRQoL did not differ from
      expected values in the general Swedish population. In conclusion, the patients in
      general coped well with the situation, and adding whole-body imaging to physical 
      examinations did not affect the melanoma patients' HRQoL or levels of anxiety or 
      depression.

TI  - Soluble Levels of CD163, PD-L1, and IL-10 in Renal Cell Carcinoma Patients.
LID - 336 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics12020336 [doi]
AB  - CD163+ M2 macrophages have been suggested to counteract tumor immunity by
      increasing immunosuppressive mechanisms including PD-L1 and IL-10 expression.
      Soluble levels of PD-L1, IL-10, and CD163 have been reported as potential
      biomarkers in various cancers, although the prognostic value in renal cell
      carcinoma (RCC) has to be further elucidated. In the present study, we measured
      the levels of sPD-L1, sIL-10, and sCD163 in 144 blood samples from patients with 
      RCC. The levels were determined by using enzyme linked immunosorbent assays.
      Soluble PD-L1 and CD163 were detectable in 100% of the serum samples, and sCD163 
      in 22% of the urine samples, while only a minority of the samples had detectable 
      sIL-10. Significantly higher serum levels of sPD-L1 and sCD163 were observed in
      patients with metastatic disease (p < 0.05). The results also showed that
      patients with high levels of sPD-L1 in serum had shorter cancer-specific survival
      compared with patients with low levels (p = 0.002). The results indicate that
      sPD-L1 most significantly reflects tumor progression in RCC.

TI  - Social Disruption Impairs Predatory Threat Assessment in African Elephants.
LID - 495 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12040495 [doi]
AB  - The transmission of reliable information between individuals is crucial for
      group-living animals. This is particularly the case for cognitively advanced
      mammals with overlapping generations that acquire detailed social and ecological 
      knowledge over long lifetimes. Here, we directly compare the ecological knowledge
      of elephants from two populations, with radically different developmental
      histories, to test whether profound social disruption affects their ability to
      assess predatory threat. Matriarchs (</=50 years of age) and their family groups 
      received playbacks of three lions versus a single lion roaring. The family groups
      in the natural Amboseli population (Kenya) reliably assessed the greater
      predatory threat presented by three lions roaring versus one. However, in the
      socially disrupted Pilanesberg population (South Africa), no fine-scale
      distinctions were made between the numbers of roaring lions. Our results suggest 
      that the removal of older and more experienced individuals in highly social
      species, such as elephants, is likely to impact the acquisition of ecological
      knowledge by younger group members, particularly through the lack of opportunity 
      for social learning and cultural transmission of knowledge. This is likely to be 
      exacerbated by the trauma experienced by juvenile elephants that witnessed the
      culling of family members and were translocated to new reserves. With increasing 
      levels of anthropogenic disturbance, it is important that conservation
      practitioners consider the crucial role that population structure and knowledge
      transfer plays in the functioning and resilience of highly social and long-lived 
      species.

TI  - The Effect of the NorGeP-NH on Quality of Life and Drug Prescriptions in
      Norwegian Nursing Homes: A Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 32 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmacy10010032 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The effect of the Norwegian General Practice-Nursing Home (NorGeP-NH)
      criteria has never been tested on clinical outcomes in nursing home (NH)
      residents. We performed a cluster-randomized trial in Norwegian NHs and tested
      the effect of NorGeP-NH on QoL (primary outcome), medication prescriptions, and
      physical and mental health (secondary outcomes) for the enrolled residents;
      Methods: Fourteen NHs were randomized into intervention NHs (iNHs) and control
      NHs (cNHs). After baseline data collection, physicians performed NorGeP-NH on the
      enrolled residents. We assessed the difference between cNHs and iNHs in the
      change in primary outcome from baseline to 12 weeks and secondary outcomes from
      baseline to eight and 12 weeks by linear mixed models; Results: One hundred and
      eight residents (13 lost to follow-up) and 109 residents (nine lost to follow-up)
      were randomized to iNHs and cNHs, respectively. Difference in change in QoL at 12
      weeks between cNHs and iNHs was not statistically significant (mean (95% CI)):
      -1.51 (-3.30; 0.28), p = 0.101). We found no significant change in drug
      prescriptions over time. Difference in depression scores between cNHs and iNHs
      was statistically significant after 12 weeks. CONCLUSIONS: Our intervention did
      not affect QoL or drug prescriptions, but reduced depression scores in the iNHs. 
      NorGeP-NH may be a useful tool, but its effect on clinical outcomes may be scarce
      in NH residents. Further studies about the effectiveness of NorGeP-NH in other
      healthcare contexts and settings are recommended.

TI  - Risk factors, management, and outcomes of Acanthamoeba keratitis: A retrospective
      analysis of 110 cases.
PG  - 101372
LID - 10.1016/j.ajoc.2022.101372 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To evaluate the risk factors, medical and surgical management, and
      visual outcomes of patients affected by Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) over a
      16-year period. OBSERVATIONS: Records were reviewed retrospectively for all AK
      patients treated at University of Iowa between 2002 and 2017. Main outcomes
      measured were risk factors, time to diagnosis, coinfection types, initial and
      final visual acuities, and treatment outcomes, with failure of medical therapy
      defined as need for therapeutic keratoplasty (TK). Effects of steroid use on
      these outcomes were determined. Among all AK cases occurring during the study
      period (N = 110), the median age of the AK cohort was 31 years (range 8-80
      years), and 49.1% were men. Contact lens wear was the primary risk factor for AK 
      (95/100, 86.4%), and the median time to diagnosis was 0.70 (0.23-1.23) months.
      Forty-four AK patients (40%) failed medical therapy. Vision outcomes were better 
      for AK patients with successful medical therapy compared to those requiring TK
      (LogMAR 0.00 v. 0.30; p < 0.0001). Corticosteroid use was associated with
      increased time to diagnosis (1.00 v. 0.50 months; p = 0.002), decreased final
      vision (LogMAR 0.10 v. 0.00; p < 0.05) and increased need for TK (40/77 v. 4/33; 
      p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS AND IMPORTANCE: Acanthamoeba keratitis cases have
      increased over the past two decades at our institution. In this large
      retrospective study, AK was commonly misdiagnosed with delayed diagnosis and high
      rates of failed medical therapy. Corticosteroid use before AK diagnosis led to
      poorer outcomes. Our findings underscore the need for ophthalmologists to suspect
      Acanthamoeba in the setting of contact lens-associated keratitis before topical
      steroids are initiated.

AB  - We performed coproparasitological testing of free-living golden-headed lion
      tamarins, Leontopithecus chrysomelas, using the Hoffmann-Pons-Janner method. In
      total, we collected 118 samples from ten groups: four living in Federal Protected
      Area and six living in Non-Protected Areas of cocoa farms. Eggs from parasites of
      the Acanthocephala phylum and Spiruridae, Ancylostomatidae, Ascarididae and
      Oxyuridae families were identified, as well as the genus Strongyloides (Nematode:
      Strongyloididae) and phylum Apicomplexa. This is the first description of
      infection with coccidian, Trichuridae family and Strongyloides spp. in L.
      chrysomelas. A total of 48% (n= 57) of the animals were infected and the highest 
      prevalence (37.2+/-SD 8.72, n = 44) was for Acanthocephalidae, followed by
      Spiruridae (8.5+/-SD 5.03, n = 10). There was no difference in parasite
      prevalence by age classes or sex. However, we found higher diversity and
      prevalence of parasites in animals living in the Federal Protected Area. These
      results suggest that intestinal parasites may be influenced by environmental
      factors, such as the management of the areas where the animals live, in addition 
      to the feeding behavior of L. chrysomelas and distinct transmission strategies of
      parasites. The combination of ecological and demographic data combined with
      parasitological studies may contribute to conservation programs for this species.

AB  - How ecosystems maintain stability is an active area of research. Inspired by
      applications of random matrix theory in nuclear physics, May showed decades ago
      that in an ecosystem model with many randomly interacting species, increasing
      species diversity decreases the stability of the ecosystem. There have since been
      many additions to May's efforts, one being an improved understanding the effect
      of mutualistic, competitive, or predator-prey-like correlations between pairs of 
      species. Here we extend a random matrix technique developed in the context of
      spin-glass theory to study the effect of high-order correlations among species
      interactions. The resulting analytically solvable models include
      next-to-nearest-neighbor correlations in the species interaction network, such as
      the enemy of my enemy is my friend, as well as higher-order correlations. We find
      qualitative differences from May and others' models, including nonmonotonic
      diversity-stability relationships. Furthermore, inclusion of particular
      next-to-nearest-neighbor correlations in predator-prey as opposed to
      mutualist-competitive networks causes the former to transition to being more
      stable at higher species diversity. We discuss potential applicability of our
      results to microbiota engineering and to the ecology of interpredator
      interactions, such as cub predation between lions and hyenas as well as
      companionship between humans and dogs.

      following challenge with heterologous variants of concern.
LID - 10.7554/eLife.75537 [doi]
LID - e75537 [pii]
AB  - Despite mass public health efforts, the SARS-CoV2 pandemic continues as of late
      2021 with resurgent case numbers in many parts of the world. The emergence of
      SARS-CoV2 variants of concern (VoCs) and evidence that existing vaccines that
      were designed to protect from the original strains of SARS-CoV-2 may have reduced
      potency for protection from infection against these VoC is driving continued
      development of second-generation vaccines that can protect against multiple VoC. 
      In this report, we evaluated an alphavirus-based replicating RNA vaccine
      expressing Spike proteins from the original SARS-CoV-2 Alpha strain and recent
      VoCs delivered in vivo via a lipid inorganic nanoparticle. Vaccination of both
      mice and Syrian Golden hamsters showed that vaccination induced potent
      neutralizing titers against each homologous VoC but reduced neutralization
      against heterologous challenges. Vaccinated hamsters challenged with homologous
      SARS-CoV2 variants exhibited complete protection from infection. In addition,
      vaccinated hamsters challenged with heterologous SARS-CoV-2 variants exhibited
      significantly reduced shedding of infectious virus. Our data demonstrate that
      this vaccine platform can be updated to target emergent VoCs, elicits significant
      protective immunity against SARS-CoV2 variants and supports continued development
      of this platform.

OAB - Since 2019, the SARS-CoV-2 virus has spread worldwide and caused hundreds of
      millions of cases of COVID-19. Vaccines were rapidly developed to protect people 
      from becoming severely ill from the virus and decrease the risk of death.
      However, new variants - such as Alpha, Beta and Omicron - have emerged that the
      vaccines do not work as well against, contributing to the ongoing spread of the
      virus. One way to overcome this is to create a vaccine that can be quickly and
      easily updated to target new variants, like the vaccine against influenza. Many
      of the vaccines made against COVID-19 use a new technology to introduce the RNA
      sequence of the spike protein on the surface of SARS-CoV-2 into our cells. Once
      injected, our cells use their own machinery to build the protein, or 'antigen',
      so the immune system can learn how to recognize and destroy the virus. Here,
      Hawman et al. have renovated an RNA vaccine they made in 2020 which provides
      immunity against the original strain of SARS-CoV-2 in monkeys and mice. In the
      newer versions of the vaccine, the RNA was updated with a sequence that matches
      the spike protein on the Beta or Alpha variant of the virus. Both the original
      and updated vaccines were then administered to mice and hamsters to see how well 
      they worked against SARS-CoV-2 infections. The experiment showed that all three
      vaccines caused the animals to produce antibodies that can neutralize the
      original, Alpha and Beta strains of the virus. Vaccinated hamsters were then
      infected with one of the three variants - either matched or mismatched to their
      vaccination - to see how much protection each vaccine provided. All the vaccines 
      reduced the amount of virus in the animals after infection and mitigated damage
      in their lungs. But animals that received a vaccine which corresponded to the
      SARS-CoV-2 strain they were infected with had slightly better protection. These
      findings suggest that these vaccines work best when their RNA sequence matches
      the strain responsible for the infection; however, even non-matched vaccines
      still provide a decent degree of protection. Furthermore, the data demonstrate
      that the vaccine platform created by Hawman et al. can be easily updated to
      target new strains of SARS-CoV-2 that may emerge in the future. Recently, the
      Beta variant of the vaccine entered clinical trials in the United States (led by 
      HDT Bio) to evaluate whether it can be used as a booster in previously vaccinated
      individuals as well as unvaccinated participants.

TI  - Identification and critical appraisal of evidence for interventions for
      refractive error to support the development of the WHO package of eye care
      interventions: a systematic review of clinical practice guidelines.
PG  - 526-533
LID - 10.1111/opo.12963 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The World Health Organization is developing a Package of Eye Care
      Interventions (PECI) to support the integration of eye health care into national 
      health programmes. Interventions included in the PECI should be based on robust
      evidence where available. Refractive error is a leading cause of blindness and
      vision impairment and is a PECI priority condition. The aim of this study was to 
      provide high-quality evidence to support the development of the PECI by
      identifying and critically appraising clinical practice guidelines (CPGs), and
      extracting recommendations for refractive error interventions. METHODS: We
      searched for CPGs on refractive error published in the last 10 years. We
      conducted the searches initially in February and March 2019 and repeated them in 
      March 2020. We evaluated the quality of potentially relevant guidelines using the
      Appraisal of Guidelines for Research and Evaluation (AGREE) II tool. RESULTS: We 
      identified 12 high-quality CPGs relevant to refractive error, written by six
      organisations from three high-income countries. Organisations used a variety of
      frameworks to assess the strength of recommendations based on available evidence,
      with the Grading of Recommendations Assessment, Development and Evaluation
      (GRADE) being most common. Vision screening for children aged 3 to 5 years was
      recommended consistently. Evidence for screening and eye evaluations at other
      ages was weaker, although ophthalmic professional organisations consistently
      recommended regular evaluations. Recommendations on optical and laser correction 
      of refractive error were limited and did not consider implications for low
      resource settings. Interventions for slowing myopia progression in children were 
      recommended, but these will need regular updating as new evidence emerges.
      CONCLUSIONS: Current high-quality guidelines on refractive error have been
      formulated in high-income countries. Recommendations focused on prevention and
      treatment of refractive error in low-and middle-income countries are lacking.
      Regular updating of systematic reviews and CPGs is essential to ensure that
      robust evidence is promptly appraised and incorporated into recommendations for
      eye health care practitioners.

PG  - 1511-1528
LID - 10.1038/s41416-022-01723-8 [doi]
AB  - Uveal melanoma (UM) is the most common primary intraocular malignancy affecting
      adults. Despite successful local treatment of the primary tumour, metastatic
      disease develops in up to 50% of patients. Metastatic UM carries a particularly
      poor prognosis, with no effective therapeutic option available to date. Genetic
      studies of UM have demonstrated that cytogenetic features, including gene
      expression, somatic copy number alterations and specific gene mutations can allow
      more accurate assessment of metastatic risk. Pre-emptive therapies to avert
      metastasis are being tested in clinical trials in patients with high-risk UM.
      However, current prognostic methods require an intraocular tumour biopsy, which
      is a highly invasive procedure carrying a risk of vision-threatening
      complications and is limited by sampling variability. Recently, a new diagnostic 
      concept known as "liquid biopsy" has emerged, heralding a substantial potential
      for minimally invasive genetic characterisation of tumours. Here, we examine the 
      current evidence supporting the potential of blood circulating tumour cells
      (CTCs), circulating tumour DNA (ctDNA), microRNA (miRNA) and exosomes as
      biomarkers for UM. In particular, we discuss the potential of these biomarkers to
      aid clinical decision making throughout the management of UM patients.

AB  - Periorbital necrotizing fasciitis carries serious risks of loss of vision, eye,
      and life, and thus represents a true emergency. As such, clinicians must have an 
      appropriate index of suspicion for necrotizing fasciitis and, upon recognition,
      need to address the disease rapidly and thoroughly. I review the classic
      features, systemic implications, and management paradigms of necrotizing
      fasciitis in the hopes of improving outcomes.

TI  - Stable and Solution-Processable Cumulenic sp-Carbon Wires: A New Paradigm for
      Organic Electronics.
PG  - e2110468
LID - 10.1002/adma.202110468 [doi]
AB  - Solution-processed, large-area, and flexible electronics largely relies on the
      excellent electronic properties of sp(2) -hybridized carbon molecules, either in 
      the form of pi-conjugated small molecules and polymers or graphene and carbon
      nanotubes. Carbon with sp-hybridization, the foundation of the elusive allotrope 
      carbyne, offers vast opportunities for functionalized molecules in the form of
      linear carbon atomic wires (CAWs), with intriguing and even superior predicted
      electronic properties. While CAWs represent a vibrant field of research, to date,
      they have only been applied sparingly to molecular devices. The recent
      observation of the field-effect in microcrystalline cumulenes suggests their
      potential applications in solution-processed thin-film transistors but concerns
      surrounding the stability and electronic performance have precluded developments 
      in this direction. In the present study, ideal field-effect characteristics are
      demonstrated for solution-processed thin films of tetraphenyl[3]cumulene, the
      shortest semiconducting CAW. Films are deposited through a scalable, large-area, 
      meniscus-coating technique, providing transistors with hole mobilities in excess 
      of 0.1 cm(2 ) V(-1 ) s(-1) , as well as promising operational stability under
      dark conditions. These results offer a solid foundation for the exploitation of a
      vast class of molecular semiconductors for organic electronics based on
      sp-hybridized carbon systems and create a previously unexplored paradigm.

TI  - Decision fusion in healthcare and medicine: a narrative review.
PG  - 8
LID - 10.21037/mhealth-21-15 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To provide an overview of the decision fusion (DF) technique and
      describe the applications of the technique in healthcare and medicine at
      prevention, diagnosis, treatment and administrative levels. BACKGROUND: The rapid
      development of technology over the past 20 years has led to an explosion in data 
      growth in various industries, like healthcare. Big data analysis within the
      healthcare systems is essential for arriving to a value-based decision over a
      period of time. Diversity and uncertainty in big data analytics have made it
      impossible to analyze data by using conventional data mining techniques and thus 
      alternative solutions are required. DF is a form of data fusion techniques that
      could increase the accuracy of diagnosis and facilitate interpretation,
      summarization and sharing of information. METHODS: We conducted a review of
      articles published between January 1980 and December 2020 from various databases 
      such as Google Scholar, IEEE, PubMed, Science Direct, Scopus and web of science
      using the keywords decision fusion (DF), information fusion, healthcare, medicine
      and big data. A total of 141 articles were included in this narrative review.
      CONCLUSIONS: Given the importance of big data analysis in reducing costs and
      improving the quality of healthcare; along with the potential role of DF in big
      data analysis, it is recommended to know the full potential of this technique
      including the advantages, challenges and applications of the technique before its
      use. Future studies should focus on describing the methodology and types of data 
      used for its applications within the healthcare sector.

TI  - Screening for Glaucomatous Visual Field Defects in Rural Australia with an iPad.
PG  - 125-131
LID - 10.5005/jp-journals-10078-1312 [doi]
AB  - AIM AND OBJECTIVE: Developing improved methods for early detection of visual
      field defects is pivotal to reducing glaucoma-related vision loss. The Melbourne 
      Rapid Fields screening module (MRF-S) is an iPad-based test, which allows
      suprathreshold screening with zone-based analysis to rapidly assess the risk of
      manifest glaucoma. The versatility of MRF-S has potential utility in rural areas 
      and during infectious pandemics. This study evaluates the utility of MRF-S for
      detecting field defects in non-metropolitan settings. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This
      was a prospective, multicenter, cross-sectional validation study. Two hundred and
      fifty-two eyes of 142 participants were recruited from rural sites through two
      outreach eye services in Australia. Participants were tested using MRF-S and
      compared with a reference standard; either Zeiss Humphrey Field Analyzer or
      Haag-Streit Octopus performed at the same visit. Standardized questionnaires were
      used to assess user acceptability. Major outcome measures were the area under the
      curve (AUC) for detecting mild and moderate field defects defined by the
      reference tests, along with corresponding performance characteristics
      (sensitivity, specificity). RESULTS: The mean test duration for MRF-S was 1.88
      minutes compared with 5.92 minutes for reference tests. The AUCs for mild and
      moderate field defects were 0.81 [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.75-0.87] and
      0.87 (95% CI: 0.83-0.92), respectively, indicating very good diagnostic accuracy.
      Using a risk criterion of 55%, MRF-S identified moderate field defects with a
      sensitivity and specificity of 88.4 and 81.0%, respectively. CONCLUSION AND
      CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The MRF-S iPad module can identify patients with mild and 
      moderate field defects while delivering favorable user acceptability and short
      test duration. This has potential application within rural locations and amidst
      infectious pandemics. HOW TO CITE THIS ARTICLE: Chia MA, Trang E, Agar A, et al.

TI  - Refractive Outcomes After LASIK for the Treatment of Mixed Astigmatism with the
      Allegretto WaveLight EX500.
PG  - 785-795
LID - 10.1007/s40123-022-00472-4 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Treatment of mixed astigmatism with laser in situ keratomileusis
      (LASIK) is complex as the correction requires flattening the cornea in one
      meridian while steepening the cornea in the other meridian. The bitoric technique
      has become the most popular approach and has been tested across a variety of
      platforms. This study is the first to evaluate the results of mixed astigmatism
      treatment using the Allegretto WaveLight((R)) EX500. METHODS: This study was a
      single-center, retrospective, noncomparative analysis of 400 eyes that underwent 
      LASIK to correct for mixed astigmatism utilizing the EX500 excimer laser. Data on
      uncorrected distance visual acuity, corrected distance visual acuity, and
      spherical equivalent was analyzed at consecutive intervals (1, 3, 6, 9, and 12
      months). Refractive measurements were used to perform a vector analysis. RESULTS:
      Three and 12 months postoperatively, 71% and 74% of eyes had an uncorrected
      distance visual acuity (UDVA) of 20/20 or better and 99% and 100% of eyes had a
      UDVA of 20/40 or better, respectively. The postoperative UDVA was within one line
      of the corrected distance visual acuity (CDVA) in 88% and 93% of eyes at 3 and 12
      months, respectively. At 3 months, 78% of eyes achieved refractive astigmatism no
      greater than 0.50 diopters and at 12 months, 80% achieved this. The mean
      spherical equivalent refraction was - 0.36 +/- 0.57 D at 12 months after surgery.
      At the 12-month follow-up, the mean refractive cylinder was reduced by 87%, from 
      - 2.79 to - 0.37 diopters. On vector analysis, 99% of eyes had an angle of error 
      within +/- 15 degrees from the intended target at 3 and 12 months. CONCLUSION:
      Treatment of mixed astigmatism using the Allegretto WaveLight((R)) EX500 laser
      exceeded the industry standards of safety, efficacy, stability, and accuracy.

TI  - The spatio-temporal dynamics of interacting genetic incompatibilities. Part I:
      the case of stacked underdominant clines.
PG  - 20
LID - 10.1007/s00285-022-01722-6 [doi]
AB  - We explore the interaction between two genetic incompatibilities (underdominant
      loci in diploid organisms) in a population occupying a one-dimensional space. We 
      derive a system of partial differential equations describing the dynamics of
      allele frequencies and linkage disequilibrium between the two loci, and use a
      quasi-linkage equilibrium approximation in order to reduce the number of
      variables. We investigate the solutions of this system and demonstrate the
      existence of a solution in which the two clines in allele frequency remain
      stacked together. In the case of asymmetric incompatibilities (i.e. when one
      homozygote is favored over the other at each locus), these stacked clines
      propagate in the form of a traveling wave. We obtain an approximation for the
      speed of this wave which, in particular, is decreased by recombination between
      the two loci but is always larger than the speed of "one cline alone".

TI  - Psychotropic medication deprescribing in residential aged care facilities: An
      exploratory study of the knowledge and attitudes of family members of residents
      with dementia.
LID - 10.1111/ajag.13043 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: General practitioners face many barriers to deprescribing
      psychotropic medications in people with dementia in nursing homes, including a
      lack of knowledge about their medication histories. This study explored the
      knowledge of family members about residents' medications and their willingness to
      support deprescribing. METHODS: Sixty-six family members of residents from seven 
      residential aged care facilities participated in this cross-sectional study.
      Participation involved nomination of recognised medications, rating their
      effectiveness and rating level of support for deprescribing. RESULTS: Fifty-five 
      per cent of medications were recognised by family members; significantly fewer
      psychotropics were recognised than non-psychotropic medications. Though rated as 
      just as effective, support for deprescribing psychotropics was significantly
      higher. Most family members were agreeable to deprescribing with general
      practitioner support. CONCLUSIONS: Although there is a gap in family members'
      knowledge about psychotropic medications, overall they are supportive of
      deprescribing. Findings emphasise the need for psychoeducation among family
      members. Providing family members with a list of prescribed medications,
      specifying the type of and reason for prescription and side effects of each, is
      recommended to facilitate their advocacy for deprescribing on behalf of nursing
      home residents.

      for Rescue Robots.

LID - 10.3390/s22031297 [doi]
AB  - This paper improves the accuracy of a mine robot's positioning and mapping for
      rapid rescue. Specifically, we improved the FastSLAM algorithm inspired by the
      lion swarm optimization method. Through the division of labor between different
      individuals in the lion swarm optimization algorithm, the optimized particle set 
      distribution after importance sampling in the FastSLAM algorithm is realized. The
      particles are distributed in a high likelihood area, thereby solving the problem 
      of particle weight degradation. Meanwhile, the diversity of particles is
      increased since the foraging methods between individuals in the lion swarm
      algorithm are different so that improving the accuracy of the robot's positioning
      and mapping. The experimental results confirmed the improvement of the algorithm 
      and the accuracy of the robot.

TI  - Advanced Characterisation of Soft Polymers under Cyclic Loading in Context of
      Engine Mounts.
LID - 429 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/polym14030429 [doi]
AB  - The experimental investigation of viscoelastic behavior of cyclically loaded
      elastomeric components with respect to the time and the frequency domain is
      critical for industrial applications. Moreover, the validation of this behavior
      through numerical simulations as part of the concept of virtual prototypes is
      equally important. Experiments, combined measurements and test setups for samples
      as well as for rubber-metal components are presented and evaluated with regard to
      their industrial application. For application in electric vehicles with relevant 
      excitation frequencies substantially higher than by conventional drive trains,
      high-frequency dynamic stiffness measurements are performed up to 3000 Hz on a
      newly developed test bench for elastomeric samples and components. The new test
      bench is compared with the standard dynamic measurement method for
      characterization of soft polymers. A significant difference between the measured 
      dynamic stiffness values, caused by internal resonance of the bushing, is
      presented. This effect has a direct impact on the acoustic behavior of the
      vehicle and goes undetected by conventional measurement methods due to their
      lower frequency range. Furthermore, for application in vehicles with internal
      combustion engine, where the mechanical excitation amplitudes are significantly
      larger than by vehicles with electric engines, a new concept for the
      identification of viscoelastic material parameters that is suitable for the
      representation of large periodic deformations under consideration of energy
      dissipation is described. This dissipated energy causes self-heating of the
      polymer and leads to the precocious aging and failure of the elastomeric
      component. The validation of this concept is carried out thermally and
      mechanically on specimen and component level. Using the approaches developed in
      this work, the behavior of cyclically loaded elastomeric engine mounts in
      different applications can be simulated to reduce the time spent and save on the 
      costs necessary for the production of prototypes.

TI  - Short-Term Pain Evolution and Treatment Success of Pulpotomy as Irreversible
      Pulpitis Permanent Treatment: A Non-Randomized Clinical Study.
LID - 787 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm11030787 [doi]
AB  - The objective of this work was to evaluate (1) the short-term evolution of pain
      and (2) the treatment success of full pulpotomy as permanent treatment of
      irreversible pulpitis in mature molars. The study consisted of a non-randomized
      comparison between a test group (n = 44)-full pulpotomy performed by
      non-specialist junior practitioners, and a control group (n = 40)-root canal
      treatments performed by specialized endodontists. Short-term pain score
      (Heft-Parker scale) was recorded pre-operatively, then at 24 h and 7 days
      post-operatively. Three outcomes were considered for treatment success:
      radiographic, clinical and global success. For short-term evolution of pain, a
      non-parametric Wilcoxon test was performed (significance level = 0.05). For
      treatment success, a Pearson Chi square or Fisher test were performed
      (significance level = 0.017-Bonferroni correction). There was no significant
      difference between test and control groups neither regarding short term evolution
      of pain at each time point, nor regarding clinical (80% and 90%, respectively) or
      global success (77% and 67%, respectively). However, a significant difference in 
      radiographic success was observed (94% and 69%, respectively). The present work
      adds to the existing literature to support that pulpotomy as permanent treatment 
      could be considered as an acceptable and conservative treatment option,
      potentially applied by a larger population of dentists.

TI  - Absence of 2899C<T Mutation in the WNK4 Gene in a Free-Ranging Lion (Panthera
      leo) with Polymyopathy.
LID - 389 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani12030389 [doi]
AB  - Polyphasic skeletal muscle degeneration, necrosis and mineralization of skeletal 
      muscle was diagnosed in eight juvenile free-ranging lions (Panthera leo), from
      five different litters in the Greater Kruger National Park area that were unable 
      to walk properly. A detailed investigation was not possible in free-ranging
      lions, so the cause could not be determined. The cases resembled hypokalemic
      polymyopathy in domestic cats with muscle weakness. A candidate-gene approach
      previously identified a nonsense mutation in the gene coding for the enzyme
      lysine-deficient 4 protein kinase (WNK4) associated with the disease in Burmese
      and Tonkinese cats. In this study, we sequenced all 19 exons of the gene in one
      case, and two control samples, to identify possible mutations that may be
      associated with polymyopathy in free-ranging lions. Here, no mutations were
      detected in any of the exons sequenced. Our findings indicate that the WNK4 gene 
      is not a major contributor to the condition in these lions. Further studies into 
      the pathogenesis of this condition are needed to inform conservation policies for
      this vulnerable, iconic African species.

TI  - Genotypic and Phenotypic Spectrum of Foveal Hypoplasia: A Multicenter Study.

LID - S0161-6420(22)00126-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.ophtha.2022.02.010 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To characterize the genotypic and phenotypic spectrum of foveal
      hypoplasia (FH). DESIGN: Multicenter, observational study. PARTICIPANTS: A total 
      of 907 patients with a confirmed molecular diagnosis of albinism, PAX6, SLC38A8, 
      FRMD7, AHR, or achromatopsia from 12 centers in 9 countries (n = 523) or
      extracted from publicly available datasets from previously reported literature (n
      = 384). METHODS: Individuals with a confirmed molecular diagnosis and
      availability of foveal OCT scans were identified from 12 centers or from the
      literature between January 2011 and March 2021. A genetic diagnosis was confirmed
      by sequence analysis. Grading of FH was derived from OCT scans. MAIN OUTCOME
      MEASURES: Grade of FH, presence or absence of photoreceptor specialization (PRS+ 
      vs. PRS-), molecular diagnosis, and visual acuity (VA). RESULTS: The most common 
      genetic etiology for typical FH in our cohort was albinism (67.5%), followed by
      PAX6 (21.8%), SLC38A8 (6.8%), and FRMD7 (3.5%) variants. AHR variants were rare
      (0.4%). Atypical FH was seen in 67.4% of achromatopsia cases. Atypical FH in
      achromatopsia had significantly worse VA than typical FH (P < 0.0001). There was 
      a significant difference in the spectrum of FH grades based on the molecular
      diagnosis (chi-square = 60.4, P < 0.0001). All SLC38A8 cases were PRS- (P =
      0.003), whereas all FRMD7 cases were PRS+ (P < 0.0001). Analysis of albinism
      subtypes revealed a significant difference in the grade of FH (chi-square = 31.4,
      P < 0.0001) and VA (P = 0.0003) between oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) compared
      with ocular albinism (OA) and Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (HPS). Ocular albinism
      and HPS demonstrated higher grades of FH and worse VA than OCA. There was a
      significant difference (P < 0.0001) in VA between FRMD7 variants compared with
      other diagnoses associated with FH. CONCLUSIONS: We characterized the phenotypic 
      and genotypic spectrum of FH. Atypical FH is associated with a worse prognosis
      than all other forms of FH. In typical FH, our data suggest that arrested retinal
      development occurs earlier in SLC38A8, OA, HPS, and AHR variants and later in
      FRMD7 variants. The defined time period of foveal developmental arrest for OCA
      and PAX6 variants seems to demonstrate more variability. Our findings provide
      mechanistic insight into disorders associated with FH and have significant
      prognostic and diagnostic value.

TI  - Clinical Practice Guidelines for the Detection and Treatment of Amblyopia: A
      Systematic Literature Review.
PG  - 77-85
AB  - PURPOSE: The World Health Organization's Package of Eye Care Interventions (PECI)
      aims to support incorporation of amblyopia detection and treatment into health
      service provision. The aim of this study was to systematically review clinical
      practice guidelines (CPGs) for amblyopia to inform the development of this
      package. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, CINAHL and Global Index Medicus databases,
      guideline databases and professional body websites were searched for CPGs
      published in English between 2010 and 9th March 2020. Guidelines were assessed
      using the AGREE II tool. RESULTS: Five CPGs from North America published between 
      2017-2019 were identified. One CPG provided recommendations on amblyopia
      treatment and four focused on amblyopia detection and assessment. Non-specialist 
      screening for amblyopic risk factors was recommended in children aged 3-5 years. 
      At least one comprehensive eye examination was recommended for infants and
      children aged 0-5 years. Treatment recommendations consisted of refractive
      correction followed by occlusion or cycloplegic penalization. CONCLUSIONS:
      Additional evidence is required to compare the benefits and limitations of
      comprehensive eye examinations for asymptomatic children to those from screening 
      programs. Identified CPGs were produced in high-resource countries and may not be
      readily applied in lower resource settings where the PECI has the greatest
      potential to improve service provision.

AB  - The light environments of natural water sources have specific characteristics.
      For the majority of aquatic organisms, vision is crucial for predation, hiding
      from predators, communicating information, and reproduction. Electroretinography 
      (ERG) is a diagnostic method used for assessing visual function. An
      electroretinogram records the comprehensive potential response of retinal cells
      under light stimuli and divides it into several components. Unique wave
      components are derived from different retinal cells, thus retinal function can be
      determined by analyzing these components. This review provides an overview of the
      milestones of ERG technology, describing how ERG is used to study visual
      sensitivity (e.g., spectral sensitivity, luminous sensitivity, and temporal
      resolution) of fish, crustaceans, mollusks, and other aquatic organisms (seals,
      sea lions, sea turtles, horseshoe crabs, and jellyfish). In addition, it
      describes the correlations between visual sensitivity and habitat, the variation 
      of visual sensitivity as a function of individual growth, and the diel cycle
      changes of visual sensitivity. Efforts to identify the visual sensitivity of
      different aquatic organisms are vital to understanding the environmental
      plasticity of biological evolution and for directing aquaculture, marine fishery,
      and ecosystem management.

TI  - Bone metastases from differentiated thyroid carcinoma: heterogenous tumor
      response to radioactive Iodine therapy and overall survival.
PG  - 2401-2413
LID - 10.1007/s00259-022-05697-w [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Bone metastases (BM) from differentiated thyroid carcinoma (DTC) impact 
      negatively the quality of life and the life expectancy of patients. The aim of
      the study was (a) to evaluate the overall survival (OS) and prognostic factors of
      OS and (b) to assess predictive factors of complete BM response (C-BM-R) using
      radioiodine treatment (RAI) either alone or in association with focal treatment
      modalities. METHODS: A total of 178 consecutive DTC patients harbouring BM,
      treated between 1989 and 2015, were enrolled in this retrospective study
      conducted in two tertiary referral centers. OS analysis was performed for the
      whole cohort, and only the 145 considered non-RAI refractory patients at BM
      diagnosis were evaluated for C-BM-R following RAI. RESULTS: The median OS from BM
      diagnosis was 57 months (IQR: 24-93). In multivariate analysis, OS was
      significantly reduced in the case of T4 stage, (18)FDG uptake by the BM and RAI
      refractory status. Among the 145 DTC considered non-RAI refractory patients at BM
      diagnosis, 46 patients (31.7%) achieved a C-BM-R following RAI treatment, either 
      alone in 32 (18%) patients or in association with focal BM treatment modalities
      in 14. The absence of extra-skeletal distant metastasis and of (18)FDG uptake in 
      BM were predictive for C-BM-R. CONCLUSIONS: In nearly one-third of DTC patients
      with RAI avid BM, RAI alone or in combination with BM focal treatment can induce 
      C-BM-R. The presence of (18)FDG uptake in BM is associated with an absence of
      C-BM-R and with a poor OS. (18)FDG PET-CT should be performed when BM is
      suspected.

TI  - A qualitative 5-country comparison of the perceived impacts of COVID-19 on people

PG  - 116

AB  - BACKGROUND: Emerging evidence shows an impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on people 
      living with dementia and informal carers, without any evidence-based global
      comparison to date. The aim of this international study was to explore and
      compare the perceived impact of COVID-19 and associated public health
      restrictions on the lives of people living with dementia and informal carers and 
      access to dementia care across five countries. METHODS: Informal carers and
      people living with dementia who were residing in the community in the UK,
      Australia, Italy, India, and Poland were interviewed remotely between April and
      December 2020. Participants were asked about their experiences of the pandemic
      and how restrictions have impacted on their lives and care. Transcripts were
      analysed by researchers in each country using inductive thematic analysis.
      RESULTS: Fifteen people living with dementia and 111 informal carers participated
      across the five countries. Four themes emerged: (1) Limited access and support;
      (2) Technology and issues accessing remote support; (3) Emotional impact; and (4)
      Decline of cognitive and physical health reported by carers. Whilst variations
      were noted, the pandemic has indirectly affected people with dementia and carers 
      across all five countries. The pandemic removed access to social support services
      and thus increased carer burden. Remote services were not always provided and
      were very limited in benefit and usability for those with dementia. As a result, 
      carers appeared to notice reduced cognitive and physical health in people with
      dementia. Particular differences were noted between India and Poland vs. the UK, 
      Italy, and Australia, with less impact on care provision in the former due to
      limited uptake of support services pre-pandemic based on cultural settings.
      CONCLUSIONS: The pandemic has amplified dementia as a global public health
      problem, and people affected by the condition need support to better access vital
      support services to live well.

TI  - Evaluation of corneal topography, pachymetry and higher order aberrations for
      detecting subclinical keratoconus.
PG  - 594-608
LID - 10.1111/opo.12956 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare corneal topography, pachymetry and higher order aberrations
      in keratoconic and normal eyes; to investigate their association in keratoconic
      eyes; and to determine their diagnostic ability for detecting subclinical
      keratoconus in a Nepalese population. METHODS: Ninety-six eyes of 48 keratoconus 
      patients and 50 normal eyes of 50 control subjects were included in this study.
      The eyes of keratoconus patients were classified into four different study
      groups: subclinical, stage 1, stage 2 and advanced stage keratoconus. In each
      eye, corneal topography, pachymetry and corneal aberrometry indices were measured
      using a Sirius corneal tomographer. The study parameters of keratoconic eyes were
      compared with normal eyes, and the possible association of corneal aberrometry
      with topography and pachymetry indices was investigated. The area under curve
      (AUC) of receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves along with optimal cutoff
      values with best sensitivity and specificity were also determined for each index 
      to detect subclinical keratoconus. RESULTS: All the indices except average
      keratometry measurements (Kavg and mmavg ) and spherical aberration (SA) were
      found to be significantly different in subclinical keratoconus compared to the
      control group (p < 0.05). In keratoconic eyes, all corneal aberrations were
      significantly correlated with the topography and pachymetry indices (range of
      rho: -0.25 to 0.96; all p < 0.05) except for trefoil and minimum corneal
      thickness (Thkmin ). All the indices except Kavg , mmavg and SA showed excellent 
      diagnostic ability (AUC > 0.90) in detecting subclinical keratoconus. The cutoff 
      values proposed for the asymmetry index of the corneal back surface (SIb ),
      Strehl ratio of point spread function (PSF), coma and Baiocchi-Calossi-Versaci
      index of corneal back surface (BCVb ) each showed excellent sensitivity (100%)
      and specificity (>/=97%). CONCLUSIONS: Corneal higher order aberrations were
      found to be significantly elevated in subclinical keratoconus compared to healthy
      controls. SIb , PSF, coma and BCVb were identified as the most powerful Sirius
      indices for the detection of subclinical keratoconus.

      developing countries. In Ethiopia, it is the first and fourth cause of newborn
      and under-5 deaths, respectively. From 2015 to present, the government of
      Ethiopia showed its effort to improve the survival of neonates, mainly preterm
      births, through the inclusion of high-impact life-saving neonatal interventions. 
      Despite these efforts, the cause of preterm neonatal death is still not reduced
      as expected. Therefore, this study aimed to identify determinants of preterm
      neonatal mortality. METHODS: An institution-based retrospective case-cohort study
      was conducted among a cohort of preterm neonates who were born between March 2013
      and February 2018. A total of 170 cases were considered when the neonates died
      during the retrospective follow-up period, which was confirmed by reviewing a
      medical death certificate. Controls were 404 randomly selected charts of neonates
      who survived the neonatal period. Data were collected from patient charts using a
      data extraction tool, entered using EpiData V.3.1 and analysed using STATA V.14. 
      Finally, a multivariate logistic regression analysis was performed, and goodness 
      of fit of the final model was tested using the likelihood ratio test. Statistical
      significance was declared at a p value of </=0.05. RESULTS: In this study, the
      overall incidence rate of mortality was 39.1 (95% CI: 33.6 to 45.4) per 1000
      neonate-days. Maternal diabetes mellitus (adjusted OR (AOR): 2.3 (95% CI: 1.4 to 
      3.6)), neonatal sepsis (AOR: 1.6 (95% CI: 1.1 to 2.4)), respiratory distress
      (AOR: 1.5 (95% CI: 1.1 to 2.3)), extreme prematurity (AOR: 2.9 (95% CI: 1.61 to
      5.11)), low Apgar score (AOR: 3.1 (95% CI: 1.79 to 5.05)) and premature rupture
      of membranes (AOR: 2.3 (95% CI: 1.8 to 3.5)) were found to be predictors.
      CONCLUSION: In this study, the overall incidence was found to be high. Premature 
      rupture of membranes, maternal diabetes mellitus, sepsis, respiratory distress,
      extreme prematurity and low Apgar score were found to be predictors of neonatal
      mortality. Therefore, it should be better to give special attention to patients
      with significantly associated factors.

LID - 10.33314/jnhrc.v19i3.2292 [doi]
AB  - Intravitreal steroid implants are the latest trend for uveitis macular oedema
      treatment. Dexamethasone intravitreal implants are new in our contexts but we
      report 2 cases of uveitic cystoid macular oedema where this implant proved very
      useful in the treatment of recalcitrant macular oedema where other treatment
      modality fails. Two cases of non-infectious uveitis and intermediate uveitis with
      recalcitrant uveitic macular oedema underwent dexamethasone intravitreal
      implantation. Their central macular thickness and central macular volume reduced 
      significantly with the implant. With the reduction in macular parameters, the
      best-corrected visual acuity also improved and visual rehabilitation was
      achieved. Thus, dexamethasone intravitreal implant helps in sustained drug
      delivery inside the vitreous leading to resolution of uveitic macular oedema in
      recalcitrant cases. Keywords: Macular oedema; ozurdex; steroid; uveitis; vision.

TI  - Measurement Properties of the Attitudes to Gene Therapy for the Eye (AGT-Eye)
      Instrument for People With Inherited Retinal Diseases.
PG  - 14
LID - 10.1167/tvst.11.2.14 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess the measurement properties of the Attitudes to Gene Therapy
      for the Eye (AGT-Eye) instrument among Australian adults with inherited retinal
      diseases (IRDs) and parents/caregivers of people with IRDs. Constructs of
      interest included sources of information, knowledge of treatment methods,
      awareness of treatment outcomes, and perceived value of gene therapy for IRDs.
      METHODS: A cross-sectional, self-reported, 30-item questionnaire was administered
      in English from January to June 2021. It was predominantly conducted online with 
      phone and paper alternatives available. Rating scale models were generated
      separately for each of the four subscales to assess fit, discrimination, and
      differential item functioning of the items, as well as targeting, reliability,
      and precision of the subscales. Principal components analysis was used to assess 
      dimensionality. RESULTS: Responses from 681 participants (87.1% online, 12.9%
      phone/mail) were included (ages 18-93 years; 51.7% female). Removal of two poorly
      performing items slightly improved subscale properties. Item reliability was high
      for each of the subscales; however, person reliability was suboptimal, with
      limited ability to stratify participants according to traits (person separation
      coefficient < 1.8 for each subscale). There was no evidence of differential item 
      functioning by gender, online completion, or patient/caregiver status. Evidence
      of multidimensionality was detected for two subscales. CONCLUSIONS: Four
      subscales of the AGT-Eye will be used to analyze operational knowledge and
      perceived value of ocular gene therapy in Australia. Measurement properties may
      be improved with the generation of additional items. TRANSLATIONAL RELEVANCE:
      Physicians can use the AGT-Eye to assess knowledge and expectations of potential 
      recipients of ocular gene therapy for IRDs.

TI  - Non-thrombotic pulmonary embolism of brain, liver, or bone marrow tissues
      associated with traumatic injuries in free-ranging neotropical primates.
PG  - 482-488
LID - 10.1177/03009858221075595 [doi]
AB  - From 2016 to 2019, Southeastern Brazil faced an outbreak of yellow fever (YF)
      affecting both humans and New World primates (NWP). The outbreak was associated
      with a marked increase in traumatic lesions in NWP in the affected regions.
      Non-thrombotic pulmonary embolization (NTPE) can be a consequence of massive
      traumatic events, and it is rarely reported in human and veterinary medicine.
      Here, we describe NTPE of the brain, liver, and bone marrow in free-ranging NWP, 
      highlighting the epidemiological aspects of these findings and the lesions
      associated with this condition, including data on traumatic injuries in wild NWP 
      populations during the course of a recent YF outbreak. A total of 1078 NWP were
      necropsied from January 2017 to July 2019. Gross traumatic injuries were observed
      in 444 marmosets (44.3%), 10 howler monkeys (23.2%), 9 capuchins (31.0%), 1
      titi-monkey (50.0%), and 1 golden lion tamarin (33.3%). NTPE was observed in 10
      animals, including 9 marmosets (2.0%) and 1 howler monkey (10.0%). NTPE was
      identified in the lung and comprised hepatic tissue in 1 case, brain tissue in 1 
      case, and bone marrow tissue in 8 cases. Although uncommon, it is important to
      consider NTPE with pulmonary vascular occlusion during the critical care of
      traumatized NWP. In addition, this study highlights the importance of
      conservational strategies and environmental education focusing on One Health, not
      only to protect these free-ranging NWP populations but also to maintain the
      efficacy of epidemiological surveillance programs.

TI  - Localised relative scotoma in cuticular drusen.
PG  - 2157-2164
LID - 10.1007/s00417-022-05570-4 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate retinal sensitivity changes in eyes with pure cuticular
      drusen. METHODS: Multimodal imaging and microperimetry (37-loci grid) data were
      examined retrospectively to evaluate functional changes in eyes with pure
      cuticular drusen. Mean sensitivity in the cuticular drusen cohort was compared to
      age-matched normals. An age- and loci-specific normative reference was created to
      analyse localised sensitivity deviation. RESULTS: The mean number loci with
      relative scotoma in the cuticular drusen cohort (n = 27, mean [SD] age: 48.5
      [12.4] years) referenced to normal eyes (n = 80, 53.5 [14.6] years) was 5.5 (95% 
      confidence interval 3.0 to 8.1). However, mean sensitivity was not statistically 
      different to the age-matched normal cohort (95% CI, - 2.3 to + 3.4 dB). The
      37-loci grid was stratified into three rings of the approximately same number of 
      loci, and the percentage of cuticular drusen eyes with pointwise deviation was
      significantly lower in the inner compared to the middle ring (12.3 [5.3]% vs.
      17.3 [5.1]%, p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Eyes with cuticular drusen demonstrated
      relative scotoma, but mean sensitivity was not affected. Pointwise sensitivity
      provides a more robust measure of retinal sensitivity than mean sensitivity in
      cuticular drusen and should be assessed both in the clinic and in future clinical
      trials.

TI  - Leopard and spotted hyena densities in the Lake Mburo National Park, southwestern
      Uganda.
PG  - e12307
LID - 10.7717/peerj.12307 [doi]
AB  - Robust measures of animal densities are necessary for effective wildlife
      management. Leopards (Panthera pardus) and spotted hyenas (Crocuta Crocuta) are
      higher order predators that are data deficient across much of their East African 
      range and in Uganda, excepting for one peer-reviewed study on hyenas, there are
      presently no credible population estimates for these species. A lack of
      information on the population status and even baseline densities of these species
      has ramifications as leopards are drawcards for the photo-tourism industry, and
      along with hyenas are often responsible for livestock depredations from
      pastoralist communities. Leopards are also sometimes hunted for sport.
      Establishing baseline density estimates for these species is urgently needed not 
      only for population monitoring purposes, but in the design of sustainable
      management offtakes, and in assessing certain conservation interventions like
      financial compensation for livestock depredation. Accordingly, we ran a
      single-season survey of these carnivores in the Lake Mburo National Park of
      south-western Uganda using 60 remote camera traps distributed in a paired format 
      at 30 locations. We analysed hyena and leopard detections under a Bayesian
      spatially explicit capture-recapture (SECR) modelling framework to estimate their
      densities. This small national park (370 km(2)) is surrounded by Bahima
      pastoralist communities with high densities of cattle on the park edge (with
      regular park incursions). Leopard densities were estimated at 6.31
      individuals/100 km(2) (posterior SD = 1.47, 95% CI [3.75-9.20]), and spotted
      hyena densities were 10.99 individuals/100 km(2), but with wide confidence
      intervals (posterior SD = 3.35, 95% CI [5.63-17.37]). Leopard and spotted hyena
      abundance within the boundaries of the national park were 24.87 (posterior SD
      7.78) and 39.07 individuals (posterior = SD 13.51) respectively. Leopard
      densities were on the middle end of SECR studies published in the peer-reviewed
      literature over the last 5 years while spotted hyena densities were some of the
      first reported in the literature using SECR, and similar to a study in Botswana
      which reported 11.80 spotted hyenas/100 km(2). Densities were not noticeably
      lower at the park edge, and in the southwest of our study site, despite repeated 
      cattle incursions into these areas. We postulate that the relatively high
      densities of both species in the region could be owed to impala Aepyceros
      melampus densities ranging from 16.6-25.6 impala/km(2). Another, potential
      explanatory variable (albeit a speculative one) is the absence of interspecific
      competition from African lions (Panthera leo), which became functionally extinct 
      (there is only one male lion present) in the park nearly two decades ago. This
      study provides the first robust population estimate of these species anywhere in 
      Uganda and suggests leopards and spotted hyenas continue to persist in the highly
      modified landscape of Lake Mburo National Park.

TI  - An epi-evolutionary model for predicting the adaptation of spore-producing
      pathogens to quantitative resistance in heterogeneous environments.
PG  - 95-110
LID - 10.1111/eva.13328 [doi]
AB  - We have modeled the evolutionary epidemiology of spore-producing plant pathogens 
      in heterogeneous environments sown with several cultivars carrying quantitative
      resistances. The model explicitly tracks the infection-age structure and genetic 
      composition of the pathogen population. Each strain is characterized by
      pathogenicity traits determining its infection efficiency and a time-varying
      sporulation curve taking into account lesion aging. We first derived a general
      expression of the basic reproduction number R 0 for fungal pathogens in
      heterogeneous environments. We show that the evolutionary attractors of the model
      coincide with local maxima of R 0 only if the infection efficiency is the same on
      all host types. We then studied the contribution of three basic resistance
      characteristics (the pathogenicity trait targeted, resistance effectiveness, and 
      adaptation cost), in interaction with the deployment strategy (proportion of
      fields sown with a resistant cultivar), to (i) pathogen diversification at
      equilibrium and (ii) the shaping of transient dynamics from evolutionary and
      epidemiological perspectives. We show that quantitative resistance affecting only
      the sporulation curve will always lead to a monomorphic population, whereas
      dimorphism (i.e., pathogen diversification) can occur if resistance alters
      infection efficiency, notably with high adaptation costs and proportions of the
      resistant cultivar. Accordingly, the choice of the quantitative resistance genes 
      operated by plant breeders is a driver of pathogen diversification. From an
      evolutionary perspective, the time to emergence of the evolutionary attractor
      best adapted to the resistant cultivar tends to be shorter when resistance
      affects infection efficiency than when it affects sporulation. Conversely, from
      an epidemiological perspective, epidemiological control is always greater when
      the resistance affects infection efficiency. This highlights the difficulty of
      defining deployment strategies for quantitative resistance simultaneously
      maximizing epidemiological and evolutionary outcomes.

TI  - Genetic guidelines for translocations: Maintaining intraspecific diversity in the
      lion (Panthera leo).
PG  - 22-39
LID - 10.1111/eva.13318 [doi]
AB  - Conservation translocations have become an important management tool,
      particularly for large wildlife species such as the lion (Panthera leo). When
      planning translocations, the genetic background of populations needs to be taken 
      into account; failure to do so risks disrupting existing patterns of genetic
      variation, ultimately leading to genetic homogenization, and thereby reducing
      resilience and adaptability of the species. We urge wildlife managers to include 
      knowledge of the genetic background of source/target populations, as well as
      species-wide patterns, in any management intervention. We present a hierarchical 
      decision-making tool in which we list 132 lion populations/lion conservation
      units and provide information on genetic assignment, uncertainty and suitability 
      for translocation for each source/target combination. By including four levels of
      suitability, from 'first choice' to 'no option', we provide managers with a range
      of options. To illustrate the extent of international trade of lions, and the
      potential disruption of natural patterns of intraspecific diversity, we mined the
      CITES Trade Database for estimated trade quantities of live individuals imported 
      into lion range states during the past 4 decades. We identified 1056 recorded
      individuals with a potential risk of interbreeding with wild lions, 772 being
      captive-sourced. Scoring each of the records with our decision-making tool
      illustrates that only 7% of the translocated individuals were 'first choice' and 
      73% were 'no option'. We acknowledge that other, nongenetic factors are important
      in the decision-making process, and hence a pragmatic approach is needed. A
      framework in which source/target populations are scored based on suitability is
      not only relevant to lion, but also to other species of wildlife that are
      frequently translocated. We hope that the presented overview supports managers to
      include genetics in future management decisions and contributes towards
      conservation of the lion in its full diversity.

TI  - Access to eye care during the COVID-19 pandemic, India.
PG  - 135-143
LID - 10.2471/BLT.21.286368 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To study the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
      pandemic on outpatient visits to eye care facilities in south India. METHODS: We 
      used data on 7.69 million outpatient visits to primary (i.e. vision centres),
      secondary and tertiary Aravind Eye Care System's centres between January 2019 and
      June 2021. We compared outpatient numbers and outpatients' age and sex between
      the pandemic period and the pre-pandemic period in 2019 for all centres, whereas 
      vision and ophthalmic assessments were compared for vision centres only.
      FINDINGS: During the first wave, the number of outpatient visits at tertiary,
      secondary and vison centres was 39% (647 968/1 656 296), 60% (170 934/283 176)
      and 73% (180 502/246 282) respectively, of 2019 levels. During the second wave,
      outpatient visits at tertiary, secondary and vision centres were 54% (385 092/710
      949), 73% (88 383/121 739) and 79% (121 993/154 007), respectively, of 2019
      levels. The proportion of outpatients who were female or younger than 20 years or
      older than 60 years was significantly lower during the first and second waves
      than in 2019 (P < 0.0001 for all). The proportion of outpatients whose worse eye 
      vision was poorer than 5/60 or who required referral was significantly higher (P 
      < 0.0001 for both). CONCLUSION: Restrictive measurements led to declines in
      outpatient visits, however the decline was less at secondary and vision centres
      than at tertiary centres. Easy access to specialized ophthalmic care via
      telemedicine and the relative proximity of these centres to communities helped
      reduce barriers to access.

TI  - Cuticular Drusen in Age-Related Macular Degeneration: Association with
      Progression and Impact on Visual Sensitivity.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine the prognostic significance and impact on visual function
      of the cuticular drusen phenotype in a cohort with intermediate age-related
      macular degeneration (AMD). DESIGN: Longitudinal, observational study.
      PARTICIPANTS: Participants aged 50 years or older, with bilateral large
      conventional drusen, without late AMD. METHODS: Multimodal imaging (MMI) and
      microperimetry were performed at baseline and then every 6 months for up to 3
      years. Eyes were graded for the MMI-based presence of cuticular drusen at
      baseline. Color fundus photographs were used to grade for the presence of
      pigmentary abnormalities. OCT scans were used to calculate drusen volume. The
      associations between cuticular drusen and progression to MMI-defined late AMD
      (including OCT signs of atrophy) and the impact on visual sensitivity were
      examined with and without adjustment for the confounders of baseline age,
      pigmentary abnormalities, and drusen volume. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Time to
      develop MMI-defined late AMD and change in mean visual sensitivity. RESULTS: A
      total of 280 eyes from 140 participants were included, with 70 eyes from 35
      individuals (25%) having cuticular drusen at baseline. Cuticular drusen were not 
      significantly associated with an increased rate of progression to late AMD with
      and without adjustment for confounders (P >/= 0.784 for both). In an adjusted
      model, cuticular drusen were not associated with lower baseline visual
      sensitivity (P = 0.758) or a faster rate of visual sensitivity decline (P =
      0.196). CONCLUSIONS: In a cohort with bilateral large conventional drusen,
      individuals with the cuticular drusen phenotype had neither a higher nor lower
      risk of developing late AMD over 3 years and were not associated with a
      difference in rate of visual sensitivity decline compared with those without this
      phenotype. As such, individuals with this phenotype currently warrant similar
      monitoring strategies as those with conventional drusen.

TI  - Hypogonadism: a neglected comorbidity in young and middle-aged HIV-positive men
      on effective combination antiretroviral therapy.
PG  - 1061-1071
LID - 10.1097/QAD.0000000000003176 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Male hypogonadism is poorly characterized in young-to-middle-aged
      people with HIV (PWH). We used a reliable free testosterone assay to assess the
      prevalence and predictive factors for male hypogonadism in PWH on effective
      combined antiretroviral therapy (cART). DESIGN: A French cross-sectional study
      from January 2013 to June 2016. METHODS: We included HIV-1-infected men aged
      between 18 and 50years with HIV loads of 50 RNA copies/ml or less, on effective
      cART for at least 6 months. Hypogonadism was defined, according to guidelines, as
      a mean calculated serum free testosterone concentration less than 70pg/ml
      (Vermeulen equation). Sociodemographic, anthropo-metric, bone-densitometry,
      hormonal, immunovirological, metabolic, and therapeutic parameters were
      collected. The IIEF-5, HAM-D, and AMS scales, respectively, assessed erectile
      function, depression, and quality of life. RESULTS: Overall, 240 patients were
      enrolled, 231 were analyzed. Low free testosterone concentrations (<70pg/ml) were
      recorded in 20 patients (8.7%), and were exclusively of secondary origin. In
      multivariable analysis, the risk factors predictive of male hypogonadism were age
      more than 43 years [adjusted odds ratio (aOR) 3.17, 95% confidence interval (95% 
      CI) 1.02-9.86; P = 0.04], total fat percentage more than 19% (aOR3.5, 95% CI
      1.18-10.37; P = 0.02), and treatment including efavirenz (aOR3.77, 95% CI
      1.29-10.98; P = 0.02). A nadir CD4+ T-cell count more than 200 cells / mul (aOR
      0.22, 95% CI 0.07-0.65;P < 0.01) were protective. CONCLUSION: Male hypogonadism
      remains common in young-to-middle-aged PWH with stably suppressed viral
      replication. Treatment including efavirenz, being over 43 years old, and having a
      total body fat percentage greater than 19% could be used as criteria for
      identifying PWH at risk. Early screening for male hypogonadism might improve care
      by identifying patients requiring testosterone replacement.

      and Epithelial Ingrowth with Overlying Pseudopterygium.
PG  - 967-974
LID - 10.1159/000519628 [doi]
AB  - A 73-year-old male with a history of myopic laser-assisted in situ keratomileusis
      (LASIK) 20 years earlier presented with a late LASIK flap dehiscence, epithelial 
      ingrowth, conjunctivalization, and the development of a pseudopterygium in the
      right eye. The findings were consistent with surgical trauma, likely occurring
      after corneal epithelial debridement to improve visualization during pars plana
      vitrectomy for retinal detachment repair 3 months earlier. The patient underwent 
      epithelial ingrowth debridement, LASIK flap reapproximation and suturing, and a
      conjunctival limbal autograft from the contralateral eye. The surgery was
      completed successfully without the need for flap amputation. Postoperatively, the
      patient had an uneventful course with a well-healing conjunctival graft and no
      interface opacity or evidence of recurrent pseudopterygium of the right eye. The 
      graft and corneal topography remained stable after subsequent cataract surgery.

TI  - Secondary prevention of rheumatic heart disease in Ethiopia: a multicenter study.
PG  - 26
LID - 10.1186/s12872-022-02473-4 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Ethiopia has a high acute rheumatic fever (ARF) and rheumatic heart
      disease (RHD) prevalence, and to our knowledge, there are no data on the status
      of secondary prevention in children with RHD. This study describes the status of 
      secondary RHD prevention. METHODS: A multicenter, prospective study was performed
      on children aged 5-17 years with RHD in Ethiopia. Good adherence was defined as
      at least 80% completion of benzathine penicillin (BPG) or oral Amoxicillin within
      the previous year. The primary outcome measure was adherence to prophylaxis,
      expressed as a proportion. Socio-demographics, severity of RHD, and ARF
      recurrence were evaluated. RESULTS: A total of 337 children with a mean age of
      12.9 +/- 2.6 years were included. The majority (73%) had severe aortic/mitral
      disease. Participants were on BPG (80%) or Amoxicillin (20%) prophylaxis. Female 
      sex (P = 0.04) use of BPG (0.03) and shorter mean duration of prophylaxis in
      months (48.5 +/- 31.5 vs. 60.7 +/- 33, respectively, P < 0.008) predicted good
      adherence. Running out of medications (35%), interrupted follow-up (27%), and the
      COVID-19 pandemic (26%) were the most common reasons for missing prophylaxis.
      Recurrence of ARF was higher in participants on Amoxicillin compared with BPG
      (40% vs. 16%, P < 0.001) and in those with poor adherence compared with good
      adherence (36.8% vs. 17.9%, respectively, P = 0.005). Type and duration of
      prophylaxis (OR 0.5, CI = 0.24, 0.9, P = 0.02; OR = 1.1, CI = 1.1, 1.2, P = 0.04,
      respectively), and sex (OR = 1.9, CI = 1.1, 3.4, P = 0.03) were independent
      predictors of poor adherence. CONCLUSION: Poor adherence is prevalent in
      Ethiopian children living with RHD. Amoxicillin is a suboptimal option for
      prophylaxis as its use is associated with lower adherence and a higher rate of
      ARF recurrence.

      late 19th century. These reports generally describe the findings in words, show
      drawings of the dissection, and usually include some masses of muscles, but often
      neglect to provide muscle maps showing the precise location of bony origins and
      insertions. Although these early reports can be highly useful, the absence of
      visual depictions of muscle attachment sites makes it difficult to compare muscle
      origins and insertions in living taxa and especially to reconstruct muscle
      attachments in fossil taxa. Recently, more muscle maps have been published in the
      primary literature, but those for large cats are still limited. Here, we describe
      the muscular anatomy of the forelimb of the tiger (Panthera tigris), and compare 
      muscle origins, insertions, and relative muscle masses to other felids to
      identify differences that may reflect functional adaptations. Our results
      reiterate the conservative nature of felid anatomy across body sizes and
      behavioral categories. We find that pantherines have relatively smaller shoulder 
      muscle masses, and relatively larger muscles of the caudal brachium, pronators,
      and supinators than felines. The muscular anatomy of the tiger shows several
      modifications that may reflect an adaptation to terrestrial locomotion and a
      preference for large prey. These include in general a relatively large m.
      supraspinatus (shoulder flexion), an expanded origin for m. triceps brachii caput
      longum, and relatively large m. triceps brachii caput laterale (elbow extension),
      as well as relatively large mm. brachioradialis, abductor digiti I longus, and
      abductor digiti V. Muscle groups that are well developed in scansorial taxa are
      not well developed in the tiger, including muscles of the cranial compartment of 
      the brachium and antebrachium, and m. anconeus. Overall, the musculature of the
      tiger strongly resembles that of the lion (Panthera leo), another large-bodied
      terrestrial large-prey specialist.

TI  - Clinical efficacy of diquafosol sodium 3% versus hyaluronic acid 0.1% in patients
      with dry eye disease after cataract surgery: a protocol for a single-centre,
      randomised controlled trial.
PG  - e052488
LID - 10.1136/bmjopen-2021-052488 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The number of cataract surgeries, the most common ophthalmic
      surgery, is expected to increase due to ageing populations. Dry eye disease (DED)
      is a frequent side effect of cataract surgery, contributing to lower
      postoperative patient satisfaction and suboptimal quality of vision. It is
      unclear which eye-drops commonly used in these patients should be recommended for
      postoperative DED treatment. This study aims to compare the efficacy of topical
      administration of diquafosol sodium 3% vs hyaluronic acid 0.1% eye-drops in
      patients with DED after cataract surgery. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: The study is
      designed as a single-blind randomised controlled trial. The participants will be 
      randomly (1:1) allocated to either the diquafosol sodium 3% topical
      administration group (n=21) or the hyaluronic acid 0.1% topical administration
      group (n=21). Each group will receive its assigned eye-drop intervention over a
      12-week period. The primary outcome will be measured using the total score of the
      Japanese version of the Ocular Surface Disease Index during the visit 5 weeks
      postoperatively. Both groups will be followed up after their respective eye-drop 
      application for 12 weeks according to the intervention regimens. Secondary
      outcome measures including meibomian gland function assessment, tear film
      break-up time, keratoconjunctival staining score, maximum blink interval and tear
      secretion volume using Schirmer's test I will be assessed at 1, 5, 9, 13 and 25
      weeks postoperatively. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by 
      the Juntendo Hospital Certified Review Board, Tokyo, Japan (Approved protocol
      V.7.0 dated 7 May 2021. Approval number: J20-018) and has been registered with
      the Japan Registry of Clinical Trials. Written informed consent will be collected
      from every patient prior to study participation. The results of this trial will
      be presented at local and international meetings and submitted to peer-reviewed
      journals for publication. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: jRCT1031210018.

AB  - In 1997, Donald A.B. Lindberg M.D., Director, U.S. National Library of Medicine
      (NLM) agreed to address the request of African malaria researchers for access to 
      the Internet and medical journals as part of the U.S. National Institutes of
      Health's (NIH) contribution to the Multilateral Initiative on Malaria (MIM). This
      challenge matched my interests and previous experience in Africa. I joined NLM in
      1997 to help establish the MIM Communications Network (MIMCom) in partnership
      with several NIH components and more than 30 other partners in Africa, the U.S., 
      the United Kingdom (U.K.), and Europe. After a successful launch of MIMCom, NLM
      worked with African partners to create a series of innovative programs to build
      capacity in Africa and enhance global access to indigenous African research.

TI  - gammadelta T Cells Activated in Different Inflammatory Environments Are
      Functionally Distinct.
PG  - 1224-1231
LID - 10.4049/jimmunol.2100967 [doi]
AB  - gammadelta T cells are important immunoregulatory cells in experimental
      autoimmune uveitis (EAU), and the activation status of gammadelta T cells
      determines their disease-enhancing or inhibitory effects. Because gammadelta T
      cells can be activated via various pathways, we questioned whether the nature of 
      their activation might impact their function. In this study, we show that
      gammadelta T cells activated under different inflammatory conditions differ
      greatly in their functions. Whereas anti-CD3 treatment activated both
      IFN-gamma(+) and IL-17(+) gammadelta T cells, cytokines preferentially activated 
      IL-17(+) gammadelta T cells. gammadelta T cells continued to express high levels 
      of surface CD73 after exposure to inflammatory cytokines, but they downregulated 
      surface CD73 after exposure to dendritic cells. Although both CD73(high) and
      CD73(low) cells have a disease-enhancing effect, the CD73(low) gammadelta T cells
      are less inhibitory. We also show that polarized activation not only applies to
      alphabeta T cells and myeloid cells, but also to gammadelta T cells. After
      activation under Th17-polarizing conditions, gammadelta T cells predominantly
      expressed IL-17 (gdT17), but after activation under Th1 polarizing conditions
      (gdT1) they mainly expressed IFN-gamma. The pro-Th17 activity of gammadelta T
      cells was associated with gdT17, but not gdT1. Our results demonstrate that the
      functional activity of gammadelta T cells is strikingly modulated by their
      activation level, as well as the pathway through which they were activated.

AB  - The rapid emergence of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a major concern for
      wildlife and ecosystem health globally. Genetic determinants of AMR have become
      indicators of anthropogenic pollution due to their greater association with
      humans and rarer presence in environments less affected by humans. The objective 
      of this study was to determine the distribution and frequency of the class 1
      integron, a genetic determinant of AMR, in both the faecal microbiome and in
      Escherichia coli isolated from neonates of three pinniped species. Australian sea
      lion (Neophoca cinerea), Australian fur seal (Arctocephalus pusillus doriferus)
      and long-nosed fur seal (Arctocephalus forsteri) pups from eight breeding
      colonies along the Southern Australian coast were sampled between 2016-2019. DNA 
      from faecal samples (n = 309) and from E. coli (n = 795) isolated from 884 faecal
      samples were analysed for class 1 integrons using PCRs targeting the conserved
      integrase gene (intI) and the gene cassette array. Class 1 integrons were
      detected in A. p. doriferus and N. cinerea pups sampled at seven of the eight
      breeding colonies investigated in 4.85% of faecal samples (n = 15) and 4.52% of
      E. coli isolates (n = 36). Integrons were not detected in any A. forsteri
      samples. DNA sequencing of the class 1 integron gene cassette array identified
      diverse genes conferring resistance to four antibiotic classes. The relationship 
      between class 1 integron carriage and the concentration of five trace elements
      and heavy metals was also investigated, finding no significant association. The
      results of this study add to the growing evidence of the extent to which
      antimicrobial resistant bacteria are polluting the marine environment. As AMR
      determinants are frequently associated with bacterial pathogens, their occurrence
      suggests that these pinniped species are vulnerable to potential health risks.
      The implications for individual and population health as a consequence of AMR
      carriage is a critical component of ongoing health investigations.

AB  - Intra-tumour heterogeneity (ITH) has a strong impact on the efficacy of the
      immune response against solid tumours. The number of sub-populations of cancer
      cells expressing different antigens and the percentage of immunogenic cells (i.e.
      tumour cells that are effectively targeted by immune cells) in a tumour are both 
      expressions of ITH. Here, we present a spatially explicit stochastic
      individual-based model of the interaction dynamics between tumour cells and
      CD8(+) T cells, which makes it possible to dissect out the specific impact of
      these two expressions of ITH on anti-tumour immune response. The set-up of
      numerical simulations of the model is defined so as to mimic scenarios considered
      in previous experimental studies. Moreover, the ability of the model to
      qualitatively reproduce experimental observations of successful and unsuccessful 
      immune surveillance is demonstrated. First, the results of numerical simulations 
      of this model indicate that the presence of a larger number of sub-populations of
      tumour cells that express different antigens is associated with a reduced ability
      of CD8(+) T cells to mount an effective anti-tumour immune response. Secondly,
      the presence of a larger percentage of tumour cells that are not effectively
      targeted by CD8(+) T cells may reduce the effectiveness of anti-tumour immunity. 
      Ultimately, the mathematical model presented in this paper may provide a
      framework to help biologists and clinicians to better understand the mechanisms
      that are responsible for the emergence of different outcomes of immunotherapy.

AB  - Corneal blindness is a major cause of ocular morbidity that affects 4.5 million
      people worldwide. Though penetrating keratoplasty is an excellent option for most
      patients with corneal blindness, there are various conditions for which corneal
      transplantation carries a low likelihood of success. In cases of multiple failed 
      transplants, the keratoprosthesis, an artificial cornea, is a well-documented
      surgical option, though few models are commercially available. Keratoprostheses
      also provide a solution to those in developing areas of the world who do not have
      access to penetrating keratoplasty owing to limitations in the supply of corneal 
      donor tissue. We summarize the history of keratoprostheses, examine the various
      keratoprosthesis models used across the globe, and highlight efforts to improve
      the accessibility and biointegration of keratoprosthesis through novel
      technological developments.

TI  - Hemiretinal vein occlusion 12-month outcomes are unique with vascular endothelial

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIMS: To describe baseline characteristics and 12-month outcomes with 
      vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitors of treatment-naive
      hemiretinal vein occlusion (HRVO) compared with branch (BRVO) and central (CRVO) 
      variants in routine clinical care. METHODS: A database observational study
      recruited 79 HRVO eyes, 590 BRVO eyes and 344 CRVO eyes that initiated therapy
      over 10 years. The primary outcome was mean change in visual acuity (VA-letters
      read on a logarithm of minimal angle of resolution chart) at 12 months. Secondary
      outcomes included mean change in central subfield thickness (CST), injections and
      visits. RESULTS: At baseline, mean VA in HRVO (53.8) was similar to CRVO (51.9;
      p=0.40) but lower than BRVO (59.4; p=0.009). HRVO eyes improved to match BRVO
      eyes from soon after treatment started through 12 months. Mean change in VA was
      greater in HRVO (+16.4) than both BRVO (+11.4; p=0.006) and CRVO (+8.5; p<0.001).
      Mean change in CST in HRVO (-231 microm) was similar to CRVO (-259 microm;
      p=0.33) but greater than BRVO eyes (-151 microm; p=0.003). The groups had similar
      median burdens of eight injections and nine visits. CONCLUSIONS: HRVO generally
      experienced the greatest mean change in VA of the three types of RVO when treated
      with VEGF inhibitors, ending with similar 12-month VA and CST to BRVO despite
      starting closer to CRVO. Inclusion of HRVO in BRVO or CRVO cohorts of clinical
      trials would be expected to proportionally inflate and skew the visual and
      anatomic outcomes.

TI  - Improved prognosis and evidence of enhanced immunogenicity in tumor and
      circulation of high-risk melanoma patients with unknown primary.
LID - e004310 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/jitc-2021-004310 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Melanoma of unknown primary (MUP) represents a poorly understood
      group of patients both clinically and immunologically. We investigated
      differences in prognosis and candidate immune biomarkers in patients with unknown
      compared with those with known primary melanoma enrolled in the E1609 adjuvant
      trial that tested ipilimumab at 3 and 10 mg/kg vs high-dose interferon-alfa
      (HDI). PATIENTS AND METHODS: MUP status was defined as initial presentation with 
      cutaneous, nodal or distant metastasis without a known primary. Relapse-free
      survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) rates were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier
      method. Stratified (by stage) log-rank test was used to compare RFS and OS by
      primary tumor status. Gene expression profiling (GEP) was performed on the tumor 
      biopsies of a subset of patients. Similarly, peripheral blood samples were tested
      for candidate soluble and cellular immune biomarkers. RESULTS: MUP cases
      represented 12.8% of the total population (N=1699) including 11.7% on the
      ipilimumab arms and 14.7% on the HDI arm. Stratifying by stage, RFS (p=0.001) and
      overall survival (OS) (p=0.009) showed outcomes significantly better for patients
      with unknown primary. The primary tumor status remained prognostically
      significant after adjusting for treatment and stage in multivariate Cox
      proportional hazards models. Including only ipilimumab-treated patients, RFS
      (p=0.005) and OS (p=0.023) were significantly better in favor of those with
      unknown primary. Among patients with GEP data (n=718; 102 MUP, 616 known), GEP
      identified pathways and genes related to autoimmunity, inflammation, immune cell 
      infiltration and immune activation that were significantly enriched in the MUP
      tumors compared with known primaries. Further investigation into infiltrating
      immune cell types estimated significant enrichment with CD8 +and CD4+T cells, B
      cells and NK cells as well as significantly higher major histocompatibility
      complex (MHC)-I and MHC-II scores in MUP compared with known primary. Among
      patients tested for circulating biomarkers (n=321; 66 unknown and 255 known),
      patients with MUP had significantly higher circulating levels of IL-2R (p=0.04). 
      CONCLUSION: Patients with MUP and high-risk melanoma had significantly better
      prognosis and evidence of significantly enhanced immune activation within the TME
      and the circulation, supporting the designation of MUP as a distinct prognostic
      marker in patients with high-risk melanoma.

LID - 10.7554/eLife.68388 [doi]
LID - e68388 [pii]
AB  - Antigen recognition through the T cell receptor (TCR) alphabeta heterodimer is
      one of the primary determinants of the adaptive immune response. Vaccines
      activate naive T cells with high specificity to expand and differentiate into
      memory T cells. However, antigen-specific memory CD4 T cells exist in unexposed
      antigen-naive hosts. In this study, we use high-throughput sequencing of memory
      CD4 TCRbeta repertoire and machine learning to show that individuals with
      preexisting vaccine-reactive memory CD4 T cell clonotypes elicited earlier and
      higher antibody titers and mounted a more robust CD4 T cell response to hepatitis
      B vaccine. In addition, integration of TCRbeta sequence patterns into a hepatitis
      B epitope-specific annotation model can predict which individuals will have an
      early and more vigorous vaccine-elicited immunity. Thus, the presence of
      preexisting memory T cell clonotypes has a significant impact on immunity and can
      be used to predict immune responses to vaccination.

OAB - Immune cells called CD4 T cells help the body build immunity to infections caused
      by bacteria and viruses, or after vaccination. Receptor proteins on the outside
      of the cells recognize pathogens, foreign molecules called antigens, or vaccine
      antigens. Vaccine antigens are usually inactivated bacteria or viruses, or
      fragments of these pathogens. After recognizing an antigen, CD4 T cells develop
      into memory CD4 T cells ready to defend against future infections with the
      pathogen. People who have never been exposed to a pathogen, or have never been
      vaccinated against it, may nevertheless have preexisting memory cells ready to
      defend against it. This happens because CD4 T cells can recognize multiple
      targets, which enables the immune system to be ready to defend against both new
      and familiar pathogens. Elias, Meysman, Bartholomeus et al. wanted to find out
      whether having preexisting memory CD4 T cells confers an advantage for
      vaccine-induced immunity. Thirty-four people who were never exposed to hepatitis 
      B or vaccinated against it participated in the study. These individuals provided 
      blood samples before vaccination, with 2 doses of the hepatitis B vaccine, and at
      3 time points afterward. Using next generation immune sequencing and machine
      learning techniques, Elias et al. analyzed the individuals' memory CD4 T cells
      before and after vaccination. The experiments showed that preexisting memory CD4 
      T cells may determine vaccination outcomes, and people with more preexisting
      memory cells develop quicker and stronger immunity after vaccination against
      hepatitis B. This information may help scientists to better understand how people

      isolated from northern elephant seals (Mirounga angustirostris), Mycoplasma
      phocoenae sp. nov., isolated from harbour porpoise (Phocoena phocoena), and
      Mycoplasma phocoeninasale sp. nov., isolated from harbour porpoise and California
      sea lions (Zalophus californianus).
LID - 10.1099/ijsem.0.005224 [doi]
AB  - Seven novel independent strains of Mycoplasma species were isolated from northern
      elephant seals (ES2806-NAS(T), ES2806-GEN(T), ES3157-GEN-MYC and ES3225-GEN-MYC),
      a harbour porpoise (C264-GEN(T) and C264-NAS(T)), and a California sea lion
      (CSL7498). These strains were phenotypically and genetically characterized and
      compared to the known Mycoplasma species. Four strains (C264-GEN(T), C264-NAS(T),
      CSL7498 and ES2806-NAS(T)) hydrolysed arginine but not urea and did not produce
      acid from carbohydrates. Strains ES2806-GEN(T), ES3157-GEN-MYC and ES3225-GEN-MYC
      did not produced acid from carbohydrates and did not hydrolyse arginine or urea; 
      hence, it is assumed that organic acids are used as the energy source for them.
      All were isolated and propagated in ambient air supplemented with 5+/-1 % CO2 at 
      +35-37 degrees C using either SP4 or PPLO medium. Colonies on solid medium showed
      a typical fried-egg appearance and transmission electron microscopy revealed a
      typical mycoplasma cellular morphology. The complete genomes were sequenced for
      all type strains. Average nucleotide and amino acid identity analyses showed that
      these novel strains were distant from the phylogenetically closely related
      Mycoplasma species. Based on these data, we propose four novel species of the
      genus Mycoplasma, for which the name Mycoplasma miroungirhinis sp. nov. is
      proposed with the type strain ES2806-NAS(T) (=NCTC 14430(T)=DSM 110945(T)),
      Mycoplasma miroungigenitalium sp. nov. is proposed with the type strain
      ES2806-GEN(T) (=NCTC 14429(T)=DSM 110944(T)) and representative strains
      ES3157-GEN-MYC and ES3225-GEN-MYC, Mycoplasma phocoenae sp. nov. is proposed with
      the type strain C264-GEN(T) (=NCTC 14344(T)=DSM 110687(T)) and Mycoplasma
      phocoeninasale sp. nov. is proposed with the type strain C264-NAS(T) (=NCTC
      14343(T)=DSM 110688(T)) and representative strain CSL7498. The genome G+C
      contents are 24.06, 30.09, 28.49 and 29.05% and the complete genome sizes are 779
      550, 815 486, 693 115, and 776 009 bp for strains ES2806-NAS(T), ES2806-GEN(T),
      C264-GEN(T) and C264-NAS(T), respectively.

PG  - e12639
LID - 10.1002/emp2.12639 [doi]
AB  - Individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP) are at high risk for adverse
      outcomes in the US health care system. This is particularly true for patients
      with LEP seeking care in the emergency department (ED). Although professional
      language interpretation improves the quality of care for these patients, it
      remains underused. The dynamic, discontinuous nature of an ED visit poses
      distinct challenges and opportunities for providing equitable, high-quality care 
      for patients with LEP. Evidence-based best practices for identifying patients
      with LEP and using professional interpretation are well described but
      inadequately implemented. There are few examples in the literature of rigorous
      interventions to improve quality of care and outcomes for patients with LEP.
      There is an urgent need for high-quality research to improve communication with
      patients with LEP along the continuum of emergency care in order to achieve
      equity in outcomes.

TI  - After short interbirth intervals, captive callitrichine monkeys have higher
      infant mortality.
PG  - 103724
LID - 10.1016/j.isci.2021.103724 [doi]
AB  - Life history theory predicts a trade-off between the quantity and quality of
      offspring. Short interbirth intervals-the time between successive births-may
      increase the quantity of offspring but harm offspring quality. In contrast, long 
      interbirth intervals may bolster offspring quality while reducing overall
      reproductive output. Further research is needed to determine whether this
      relationship holds among primates, which have intensive parental investment.
      Using Cox proportional hazards models, we examined the effects of interbirth
      intervals (short, normal, or long) on infant survivorship using a large
      demographic dataset (n = 15,852) of captive callitrichine monkeys (marmosets,
      tamarins, and lion tamarins). In seven of the nine species studied, infants born 
      after short interbirth intervals had significantly higher risks of mortality than
      infants born after longer interbirth intervals. These results suggest that
      reproduction in callitrichine primates may be limited by physiologic constraints,
      such that short birth spacing drives higher infant mortality.

TI  - First report of the order Mysida (Crustacea) in Antarctic marine ice caves, with

      morphology and life habits of Mysidetes species.
PG  - 145-227

AB  - SCUBA diving explorations of three islands off Dumont d'Urville Station at the
      coast of Adelie Land, East Antarctica, enabled the observation of marine ice
      caves. Sampling in this unusual habitat yielded a total of three species of
      Mysidae, altogether previously poorly known or unknown to science.
      Pseudommakryotroglodytum sp. nov. is described, based on the structure of the
      antennal scale, telson and on cornea-like lateral portions set off against the
      main body of eyeplates. Mysidetesilligi is re-established at species level after 
      almost a century in synonymy. Re-descriptions are provided for M.illigi and
      M.hanseni, based on types and ice cave materials. Keys to the Southern Ocean
      species of Pseudomma and to the world-wide species of Mysidetes are given.
      Phylogenetic trees are provided for the genera Pseudomma and Mysidetes. 18S rDNA 
      sequences of P.kryotroglodytum differ from GenBank sequences of other Pseudomma
      species. First sequence data are given for species of the genus Mysidetes: 18S
      differs between the two examined species and COI is quite diverse between and
      within species. We found previously unknown, probably sensorial structures in
      these ice cave species: in P.kryotroglodytum, the basal segment of the antennula 
      shows a pit-like depression with striated pad on the bottom and a median cyst,
      connected with the bottom of the eyeplate cleft. M.illigi shows a female
      homologue of the appendix masculina bearing a field of modified setae. Subsequent
      investigations demonstrated these structures also in species from other habitats.
      The feeding apparatus and stomach contents of the three ice cave species point to
      brushing of small particles (detritus, microalgae) from available surfaces, such 
      as sediment, rock and the ice surface. Differences in the feeding apparatus are
      very subtle between the two Mysidetes species. The high content of fat bodies in 
      M.hanseni could help it to survive periods of starvation. The large storage
      volume of the foregut in P.kryotroglodytum points to the collection of food with 
      low nutritional quality and could help to balance strongly fluctuating food
      availability. Summer specimens of M.hanseni showed a bimodal frequency of
      developmental stages in the marsupium and bimodal size-frequency distribution of 
      free-living stages. The females with younger brood (embryos) were, on average,
      larger and carried more marsupial young than those with older brood (nauplioid
      larvae). All examined incubating and spent females showed (almost) empty foreguts
      and empty ovarian tubes, suggesting possible semelparity and death following the 
      release of young. The absence of juveniles and immature females from summer
      samples suggests that growth and accumulation of fat and yolk occur outside ice
      caves, while such caves could be used by fattened adults as shelter for brooding.
      A provisional interpretation proposes a biannual life cycle for M.hanseni,
      superimposed with shifted breeding schedules, the latter characterised by early
      breeding and late breeding females, probably in response to harsh physical and
      trophic conditions along the continental coast of Antarctica.

TI  - African or Asiatic origin? Genome analyses solved the mystery of the hybrid
      origin of the rescued lion cub.

AB  - Species assignment of any seized material using DNA analysis has been a routine
      and widely accepted standard procedure in providing scientific advisory for the
      legal prosecution of wildlife cases. Scientific advancements and rigorous
      application of genetic tools have led to the development of a variety of
      molecular markers with their defined efficacy in wildlife forensics. However, in 
      a few unusual cases where a hybrid needs to be identified or assignment need to
      be made at sub-species level, mitochondrial markers often fail or else provide
      biased results, which can affect the overall judgment in the court of law. Here, 
      we report one such challenging case of lion cub rescued by the law enforcement
      from illegal trafficking. Phylogenetic assessment based on complete mitogenome
      assigned rescued lion cub with African lion (Panthera leo leo). However, the TSPY
      gene of the Y chromosome established that the lion cub shared its paternal
      lineage from Asiatic lion (Panthera leo persica). With the use of maternally and 
      paternally inherited markers, we conclude a hybrid origin of the rescued lion cub
      which shared ancestry from both Asiatic as well as African lion. The present
      study exhibits the application of genome sequencing in thinking beyond routine
      identification and contributes to the operating procedures of wildlife forensics.

TI  - Two-Stage Classification Model for the Prediction of Heart Disease Using IoMT and
      Artificial Intelligence.
LID - 476 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/s22020476 [doi]
AB  - Internet of Things (IoT) technology has recently been applied in healthcare
      systems as an Internet of Medical Things (IoMT) to collect sensor information for
      the diagnosis and prognosis of heart disease. The main objective of the proposed 
      research is to classify data and predict heart disease using medical data and
      medical images. The proposed model is a medical data classification and
      prediction model that operates in two stages. If the result from the first stage 
      is efficient in predicting heart disease, there is no need for stage two. In the 
      first stage, data gathered from medical sensors affixed to the patient's body
      were classified; then, in stage two, echocardiogram image classification was
      performed for heart disease prediction. A hybrid linear discriminant analysis
      with the modified ant lion optimization (HLDA-MALO) technique was used for sensor
      data classification, while a hybrid Faster R-CNN with SE-ResNet-101 modelwass
      used for echocardiogram image classification. Both classification methods were
      carried out, and the classification findings were consolidated and validated to
      predict heart disease. The HLDA-MALO method obtained 96.85% accuracy in detecting
      normal sensor data, and 98.31% accuracy in detecting abnormal sensor data. The
      proposed hybrid Faster R-CNN with SE-ResNeXt-101 transfer learning model
      performed better in classifying echocardiogram images, with 98.06% precision,
      98.95% recall, 96.32% specificity, a 99.02% F-score, and maximum accuracy of
      99.15%.

AB  - Reverse-zoonotic infections of severe acute respiratory syndrome-related
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) from humans to wildlife species internationally raise 
      concern over the emergence of new variants in animals. A better understanding of 
      the transmission dynamics and pathogenesis in susceptible species will mitigate
      the risk to humans and wildlife occurring in Africa. Here we report infection of 
      an exotic puma (July 2020) and three African lions (July 2021) in the same
      private zoo in Johannesburg, South Africa. One Health genomic surveillance
      identified transmission of a Delta variant from a zookeeper to the three lions,
      similar to those circulating in humans in South Africa. One lion developed
      pneumonia while the other cases had mild infection. Both the puma and lions
      remained positive for SARS-CoV-2 RNA for up to 7 weeks.

TI  - Changes in Rates and Modality of Interpreter Use for Pediatric Emergency
      Department Patients in the COVID-19 Era.
PG  - 139-146
LID - S1553-7250(21)00293-2 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jcjq.2021.11.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: As the COVID-19 pandemic continues, health care systems around the
      world have changed care delivery in significant ways. Racial and ethnic
      disparities have emerged for COVID-19 infection rates, morbidity, and mortality. 
      Inequities in care and underutilization of interpretation for patients who use a 
      language other than English (LOE) for care existed prior to this era. This study 
      sought to evaluate interpreter use in a pediatric emergency department (ED) as
      changes associated with COVID-19 were implemented. METHODS: ED records were
      reviewed from December 1, 2019, to July 31, 2020. Patients were classified as
      having LOE if they preferred a language other than English and consented to
      interpretation. Statistical process control was used to analyze changes in
      interpreter use over time, relative to the onset of COVID-19-related operational 
      changes. Beginning March 1, 2020, in-person interpreters were no longer available
      and staff were encouraged to communicate from outside the patient room when
      possible; this change served as the exposure of interest. Interpreter use for LOE
      patients, overall and by triage acuity level, was the study outcome. RESULTS: A
      total of 26,787 encounters were included. The weekly mean proportion of
      encounters that used interpretation for patients with LOE increased from 59% to
      73% after the onset of COVID-19. This increase met criteria for special cause
      variation. Interpretation modality changed to being mostly by phone from
      previously by video or in-person. CONCLUSION: Operational changes in the ED
      related to COVID-19 were associated with increased interpreter use. Possible
      explanations include lower patient volumes or changes in model of care that
      encouraged interpreter use by a variety of modalities.

TI  - Relationships between Intraocular Pressure, Effective Filtration Area, and

LID - 854 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23020854 [doi]
AB  - We investigated whether an inverse relationship exists between intraocular
      pressure (IOP) and effective filtration area (EFA) in the trabecular meshwork
      (TM) in a steroid-induced ocular hypertensive (SIOH) mouse model and the
      morphological changes associated with the reduction of EFA. C57BL/6 mice (n = 15 
      per group) received either 0.1% dexamethasone (DEX) or saline eye drops twice
      daily for five weeks. IOP was measured weekly. Fluorescent tracers were injected 
      into the anterior chamber to label EFA at the endpoint. Injected eyes were fixed 
      and processed for confocal microscopy. EFA in the TM was analyzed. Light and
      electron microscopy were performed in high- and low-tracer regions of six eyes
      per group. The mean IOP was ~4 mm Hg higher in DEX-treated than saline-treated
      control eyes (p < 0.001) at the endpoint. EFA was reduced in DEX-treated eyes
      compared to controls (p < 0.01) and negatively correlated with IOP (R(2) = 0.38, 
      p = 0.002). Reduced thickness of juxtacanalicular tissue (JCT) and increased
      abnormal extracellular matrix in the JCT were found to be associated with reduced
      EFA. Our data confirm the inverse relationship between EFA and IOP, suggesting
      that morphological changes in the JCT contribute to the reduction of EFA, thus
      elevating IOP in SIOH mouse eyes.

TI  - Primary and Secondary Cone Cell Death Mechanisms in Inherited Retinal Diseases
      and Potential Treatment Options.
LID - 726 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms23020726 [doi]
AB  - Inherited retinal diseases (IRDs) are a leading cause of blindness. To date, 260 
      disease-causing genes have been identified, but there is currently a lack of
      available and effective treatment options. Cone photoreceptors are responsible
      for daylight vision but are highly susceptible to disease progression, the loss
      of cone-mediated vision having the highest impact on the quality of life of IRD
      patients. Cone degeneration can occur either directly via mutations in
      cone-specific genes (primary cone death), or indirectly via the primary
      degeneration of rods followed by subsequent degeneration of cones (secondary cone
      death). How cones degenerate as a result of pathological mutations remains
      unclear, hindering the development of effective therapies for IRDs. This review
      aims to highlight similarities and differences between primary and secondary cone
      cell death in inherited retinal diseases in order to better define cone death
      mechanisms and further identify potential treatment options.

LID - 10.3390/cancers14020401 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: We aimed to describe the prevalence and spectrum of second primary
      cancer (SPC) in HIV-positive cancer survivors. METHODS: A multicenter
      retrospective study was performed using longitudinal data from the French
      Dat'AIDS cohort. Subjects who had developed at least two primary cancers were
      selected. The spectrum of SPCs was stratified by the first primary cancer type
      and by sex. RESULTS: Among the 44,642 patients in the Dat'AIDS cohort, 4855 were 
      diagnosed with cancer between 1 December 1983 and 31 December 2015, of whom 444
      (9.1%) developed at least two primary cancers. The most common SPCs in men were
      non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) (22.8%), skin carcinoma (10%) and Kaposi sarcoma (KS) 
      (8.4%), and in women the most common SPCs were breast cancer (16%), skin
      carcinoma (9.3%) and NHL (8%). The pattern of SPCs differed according to first
      primary cancer and by sex: in men, NHL was the most common SPC after primary KS
      and KS was the most common SPC after primary NHL; while in women, breast cancer
      was the most common SPC after primary NHL and primary breast cancer. CONCLUSION: 
      The frequency and pattern of subsequent cancers among HIV-positive cancer
      survivors differed according to the first primary cancer type and sex.

AB  - The present investigation was conducted to rule out canine distemper (CD)
      diseases in Indian wild felids (Asiatic lions, tigers, leopards, snow leopards,
      clouded leopards, leopard cats, jungle cats, civet cats, fishing cat, and
      jaguar). The collected samples were screened for CD virus (CDV) by histopathology
      (HP), immunohistochemistry (IHC) and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain
      reaction (RT-PCR) targeting H gene and N gene. The HP and IHC of suspected
      samples portrayed that 22 [11 leopards, 6 lions, 3 tigers, 1 snow leopard and 1
      civet cat] out of 129 (17.05%) wild felids were positive for CD. The major
      pathological consequences were observed in spleen, lung, kidney and brain. The
      syncytia and intranuclear as well as intracytoplasmic eosinophilic inclusion
      bodies were seen in CDV infected cells. Although the histopathological lesions in
      spleen were more specific and consistent, however, the severe demyelinated
      leukoencephalitis (usually expected in CD infected dog) was not observed in the
      brain of any Indian wild felids. Conversely, the CDV antigen has been portrayed
      via IHC in pancreatic islets of Langerhans of tiger species for the first time in
      this study. Moreover, the concurrent CD and babesiosis has also been observed in 
      a lioness without a usual coffee-coloured urine. The N gene and H gene of CDV
      isolates were amplified, sequenced and subsequently constructed the phylogenetic 
      tree. The phylogenetic analysis of H gene revealed that the CDV isolates from
      Indian lion formed separate clade with CDV isolates from Indian dog and Indian
      palm civet cat. Furthermore, two CDV isolates from Indian tigers formed clade
      with Onderstepoort vaccine strain and CDV isolates from dogs of Uttar Pradesh,
      USA and UK. Evidently, CDV is circulating in Indian wild felids and causing
      diseases in them.

TI  - Is Genetic Risk for Sleep Apnea Causally Linked With Glaucoma Susceptibility?
PG  - 25
LID - 10.1167/iovs.63.1.25 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Observational studies have suggested that individuals with pre-existing 
      sleep apnea (SA) have up to double the risk of developing glaucoma than
      individuals without SA. Understanding risk factors for glaucoma is important to
      assist with well-structured screening, early intervention, and efficient
      allocation of specialist consultation. The objective of this study is therefore
      to use genetic data to determine whether SA is a causal risk factor for glaucoma.
      Methods: Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses were performed to
      assess the association between genetically predicted SA and glaucoma
      susceptibility using genome-wide association study (GWAS) of 25,062 SA cases,
      313,372 controls derived from 23andMe and summary data from a glaucoma GWAS
      meta-analysis (20,582 cases, 119,318 controls), including individuals of European
      descent, mainly from the UK Biobank. Results: Inverse variance weighted
      regression of genetic susceptibility for SA on risk of glaucoma revealed no
      strong evidence for an association between SA and glaucoma (OR = 0.95, 95%
      confidence intervals = 0.84-1.07), results were consistent across all MR
      predictors. Conclusions: We found little genetic evidence supporting a causal
      association between SA and glaucoma. Our results refute the possibility of a
      large effect (glaucoma OR > 1.5 per doubling of odds on SA) between SA and
      glaucoma.

      Macular Degeneration.
LID - 32 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/metabo12010032 [doi]
AB  - Plasma metabolomic profiles have been shown to be associated with age-related
      macular degeneration (AMD) and its severity stages. However, all studies
      performed to date have been cross-sectional and have not assessed progression of 
      AMD. This prospective, longitudinal, pilot study analyzes, for the first time,
      the association between plasma metabolomic profiles and progression of AMD over a
      3-year period. At baseline and 3 years later, subjects with AMD (n = 108 eyes)
      and controls (n = 45 eyes) were imaged with color fundus photos for AMD staging
      and tested for retinal function with dark adaptation (DA). Fasting plasma samples
      were also collected for metabolomic profiling. AMD progression was considered
      present if AMD stage at 3 years was more advanced than at baseline (n = 26 eyes, 
      17%). Results showed that, of the metabolites measured at baseline, eight were
      associated with 3-year AMD progression (p < 0.01) and 19 (p < 0.01) with changes 
      in DA. Additionally, changes in the levels (i.e., between 3 years and baseline)
      of 6 and 17 metabolites demonstrated significant associations (p < 0.01) with AMD
      progression and DA, respectively. In conclusion, plasma metabolomic profiles are 
      associated with clinical and functional progression of AMD at 3 years. These
      findings contribute to our understanding of mechanisms of AMD progression and the
      identification of potential therapeutics for this blinding disease.

TI  - Within- and between-laboratory reproducibility and predictive capacity of amino
      acid derivative reactivity assay (ADRA) using a 0.5 mg/mL test chemical solution:
      Results of the study for reproducibility confirmation implemented in five
      participating laboratories.
PG  - 1078-1090
LID - 10.1002/jat.4279 [doi]
AB  - The amino acid derivative reactivity assay (ADRA) is an in chemico alternative
      assay for skin sensitization listed in OECD test guideline 442C. ADRA evaluates
      the reactivity of sensitizers to proteins, which is key event 1 in the skin
      sensitization adverse outcome pathway. Although the current key event 1
      evaluation method is a simple assay that evaluates nucleophile and test chemical 
      reactivity, mixtures of unknown molecular weights cannot be evaluated because a
      constant molar ratio between the nucleophile and test chemical is necessary. In
      addition, because the nucleophile is quantified by HPLC, the frequency of
      co-eluting the test chemical and nucleophile increases when measuring
      multi-component mixtures. To solve these issues, test conditions have been
      developed using a 0.5 mg/mL test chemical solution and fluorescence-based
      detection. Since the practicality of these methods has not been substantiated, a 
      validation test to confirm reproducibility was conducted in this study. The 10
      proficiency substances listed in the ADRA guidelines were tested three times at
      five different laboratories. The results of both within- and between-laboratory
      reproducibility were 100%, and the results of ultraviolet- and fluorescence-based
      measurements were also consistent. In addition to the proficiency substances, a
      new positive control, squaric acid diethyl ester, was tested three times at the
      five laboratories. The results showed high reproducibility with
      N-(2-(1-naphthyl)acetyl)-l-cysteine depletion of 37%-52% and
      alpha-N-(2-(1-naphthyl)acetyl)-l-lysine depletion of 99%-100%. Thus, high
      reproducibility was confirmed in both evaluations of the 0.5 mg/mL test chemical 
      and the fluorescence-based measurements, validating the practicability of these
      methods.

TI  - Differentiating Microaneurysm Pathophysiology in Diabetic Retinopathy Through
      Objective Analysis of Capillary Nonperfusion, Inflammation, and Pericytes.
PG  - 733-746
LID - 10.2337/db21-0737 [doi]
AB  - Microaneurysms are biomarkers of microvascular injury in diabetic retinopathy
      (DR). Impaired retinal capillary perfusion is a critical pathogenic mechanism in 
      the development of microvascular abnormalities. Targeting fundamental molecular
      disturbances resulting from capillary nonperfusion, such as increased vascular
      endothelial growth factor expression, does not always reverse the anatomic
      complications of DR, suggesting that other pathogenic mechanisms independent of
      perfusion also play a role. We stratify the effects of capillary nonperfusion,
      inflammation, and pericyte loss on microaneurysm size and leakage in DR through
      three-dimensional analysis of 636 microaneurysms using high-resolution confocal
      scanning laser microscopy. Capillary nonperfusion, pericyte loss, and
      inflammatory cells were found to be independent predictors of microaneurysm size.
      Nonperfusion alone without pericyte loss or inflammation was not a significant
      predictor of microaneurysm leakage. Microaneurysms found in regions without
      nonperfusion were significantly smaller than those found in regions with
      nonperfusion, and their size was not associated with pericyte loss or
      inflammation. In addition, microaneurysm size was a significant predictor of
      leakage in regions with nonperfusion only. This report refines our understanding 
      of the disparate pathophysiologic mechanisms in DR and provides a histologic
      rationale for understanding treatment failure for microvascular complications in 
      DR.

TI  - Atomic structure of Lanreotide nanotubes revealed by cryo-EM.
LID - e2120346119 [pii]
LID - 10.1073/pnas.2120346119 [doi]
AB  - Functional and versatile nano- and microassemblies formed by biological molecules
      are found at all levels of life, from cell organelles to full organisms.
      Understanding the chemical and physicochemical determinants guiding the formation
      of these assemblies is crucial not only to understand the biological processes
      they carry out but also to mimic nature. Among the synthetic peptides forming
      well-defined nanostructures, the octapeptide Lanreotide has been considered one
      of the best characterized, in terms of both the atomic structure and its
      self-assembly process. In the present work, we determined the atomic structure of
      Lanreotide nanotubes at 2.5-A resolution by cryoelectron microscopy (cryo-EM).
      Surprisingly, the asymmetric unit in the nanotube contains eight copies of the
      peptide, forming two tetramers. There are thus eight different environments for
      the peptide, and eight different conformations in the nanotube. The structure
      built from the cryo-EM map is strikingly different from the molecular model,
      largely based on X-ray fiber diffraction, proposed 20 y ago. Comparison of the
      nanotube with a crystal structure at 0.83-A resolution of a Lanreotide derivative
      highlights the polymorphism for this peptide family. This work shows once again
      that higher-order assemblies formed by even well-characterized small peptides are
      very difficult to predict.

TI  - Decision rules for determining terrestrial movement and the consequences for
      filtering high-resolution global positioning system tracks: a case study using
      the African lion (Panthera leo).

AB  - The combined use of global positioning system (GPS) technology and motion sensors
      within the discipline of movement ecology has increased over recent years. This
      is particularly the case for instrumented wildlife, with many studies now opting 
      to record parameters at high (infra-second) sampling frequencies. However, the
      detail with which GPS loggers can elucidate fine-scale movement depends on the
      precision and accuracy of fixes, with accuracy being affected by signal
      reception. We hypothesized that animal behaviour was the main factor affecting
      fix inaccuracy, with inherent GPS positional noise (jitter) being most apparent
      during GPS fixes for non-moving locations, thereby producing disproportionate
      error during rest periods. A movement-verified filtering (MVF) protocol was
      constructed to compare GPS-derived speed data with dynamic body acceleration, to 
      provide a computationally quick method for identifying genuine travelling
      movement. This method was tested on 11 free-ranging lions (Panthera leo) fitted
      with collar-mounted GPS units and tri-axial motion sensors recording at 1 and 40 
      Hz, respectively. The findings support the hypothesis and show that distance
      moved estimates were, on average, overestimated by greater than 80% prior to GPS 
      screening. We present the conceptual and mathematical protocols for screening fix
      inaccuracy within high-resolution GPS datasets and demonstrate the importance
      that MVF has for avoiding inaccurate and biased estimates of movement.

AB  - Primates are among the globally imperiled fauna requiring urgent conservation
      interventions to protect their habitat. Information on species distribution and
      factors influencing it are vital to species management and habitat protection. In
      this study, we assessed habitat occupancy of the lion-tailed macaque (Macaca
      silenus), bonnet macaque (M. radiata), and black-footed gray langur
      (Semnopithecus hypoleucos) that occur in the Kudremukh Wildlife Division, a large
      protected area network in the central Western Ghats. We examined the influence of
      habitat variables on the occupancy probability of these primates. We carried out 
      four temporally replicated detection/non-detection surveys to assess detection
      probability and site occupancy of the primate species. We surveyed 244 sites of 5
      Km(2), with each site surveyed for 4 days, to assess detection probability and
      site occupancy. Among the three species, the langur had the highest habitat
      occupancy estimate (0.66 +/- 0.05SE) and the lion-tailed macaque had the lowest
      estimate (0.28 +/- 0.08SE). The habitat occupancy estimate for the bonnet macaque
      was (0.56 +/- 0.05SE). Wet and semi-evergreen forest cover and mean elevation
      positively influenced the lion-tailed macaque's occurrence. Covariates
      influencing bonnet macaque's occurrence were plantations, semi-evergreen and
      moist deciduous forests, and non-forest areas. Mean elevation negatively affected
      its occurrence. Wet evergreen forests and plantations positively influenced the
      occurrence of the langur. We examined spatial segregation between the species
      based on their site occupancy. Pairwise comparisons revealed a significant
      negative association between the bonnet macaque and the other two primates.
      However, we found a significant positive association between the lion-tailed
      macaque and the langur. We discuss these results and their implications for
      conservation of primates in the region. Given the cost-effectiveness of carrying 
      out surveys at large spatial scales, we recommend occupancy surveys for future
      surveys of forest primates.

TI  - Risk and Impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 Infection on
      Corneal Transplantation: A Case-Control Study.
PG  - 224-231
LID - 10.1097/ICO.0000000000002897 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate the risk of symptomatic severe
      acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection after corneal
      transplantation surgery, with cataract surgeries as controls, and the impact of
      the novel coronavirus disease pandemic in the clinical and surgical complications
      of corneal transplantation and cataract surgeries. METHODS: A retrospective
      matched case-control study of 480 consecutive individuals who underwent surgery
      at the Bascom Palmer Eye Institute between May 2020 and November 2020. A total of
      240 patients who underwent corneal transplantation with tissue obtained from the 
      Florida Lions Eye Bank were age, race, ethnicity, and sex matched with 240
      patients who underwent cataract surgery during the same day and by the same
      surgical team. Only the first corneal transplant or cataract surgery during this 
      period was considered for each individual. All donors and recipients were deemed 
      SARS-CoV-2 negative by a nasopharyngeal polymerase chain reaction test before
      surgery. Postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infections were defined as previously
      SARS-CoV-2(-) individuals who developed symptoms or had a positive SARS-CoV-2
      polymerase chain reaction test during the first postoperative month. RESULTS:
      Mean age, sex, race, and ethnicity were similar between groups. There were no
      differences between the corneal transplant and cataract groups in the rates of
      SARS-CoV-2 infection before (5.8% vs. 7.5%, P= 0.6) or after surgery (2.9% vs.
      2.9%, P = 1). The rates of postoperative complications did not increase during
      the pandemic, compared with previously reported ranges. CONCLUSIONS: In this
      study, postoperative SARS-CoV-2 infection was similar for individuals undergoing 
      corneal transplantation or cataract surgery. Further research is required to
      evaluate the transmission of SARS-CoV-2 through corneal tissue.

AB  - A concurrent outbreak of infection with Yersinia pseudotuberculosis occurred in
      adult captive African lions (Panthera leo). Two 17-y-old male lions and one
      14-y-old female lion developed respiratory distress, lethargy, ataxia, and
      hyporexia. Within 3-5 d of the onset of clinical signs, one male and the female
      lion died and were submitted for postmortem examination. Macroscopically, the
      liver and spleen had multifocal-to-coalescing, semi-firm, pale-tan nodules
      throughout the parenchyma. The lungs were non-collapsed and marked by petechiae. 
      Histologic examination identified lytic, necrosuppurative foci in the liver,
      spleen, lungs, and kidney, with abundant intralesional gram-negative coccobacilli
      in the male lion. Similar findings were seen in the female lion in the liver,
      spleen, kidney, and mesenteric lymph node; however, the intralesional bacterial
      colonies were more pleomorphic, comprising rod and filamentous morphologies.
      Aerobic bacterial culture of the liver, spleen, and lung revealed Y.
      pseudotuberculosis growth. The source of infection is unknown, and an
      epidemiologic study was performed. Sources to be considered are from the
      predation of rodent and/or bird reservoirs, or contaminated soil or water.
      Mortality associated with Y. pseudotuberculosis has been described in an African 
      lion cub, however, to our knowledge, Y. pseudotuberculosis has not been reported 
      in adult African lions, and this is only the second report of Y.
      pseudotuberculosis with aberrant bacterial morphology observed histologically.

TI  - C(0,alpha) boundary regularity for the pressure in weak solutions of the 2d Euler
      equations.

LID - 10.1098/rsta.2021.0073 [doi]
AB  - The purpose of this article is to give a complete proof of a [Formula: see text] 
      regularity result for the pressure for weak solutions of the two-dimensional
      'incompressible Euler equations' when the fluid velocity enjoys the same type of 
      regularity in a compact simply connected domain with [Formula: see text]
      boundary. To accomplish our result, we realize that it is compulsory to introduce
      a new weak formulation for the boundary condition of the pressure, which is
      consistent with, and equivalent to, that of classical solutions. This article is 
      part of the theme issue 'Scaling the turbulence edifice (part 1)'.

LID - 10.1073/pnas.2110666119 [doi]
AB  - The limited supply of vaccines against severe acute respiratory syndrome
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) raises the question of targeted vaccination. Many
      countries have opted to vaccinate older and more sensitive hosts first to
      minimize the disease burden. However, what are the evolutionary consequences of
      targeted vaccination? We clarify the consequences of different vaccination
      strategies through the analysis of the speed of viral adaptation measured as the 
      rate of change of the frequency of a vaccine-adapted variant. We show that such a
      variant is expected to spread faster if vaccination targets individuals who are
      likely to be involved in a higher number of contacts. We also discuss the pros
      and cons of dose-sparing strategies. Because delaying the second dose increases
      the proportion of the population vaccinated with a single dose, this strategy can
      both speed up the spread of the vaccine-adapted variant and reduce the cumulative
      number of deaths. Hence, strategies that are most effective at slowing viral
      adaptation may not always be epidemiologically optimal. A careful assessment of
      both the epidemiological and evolutionary consequences of alternative vaccination
      strategies is required to determine which individuals should be vaccinated first.

AB  - Coastal management requires cost-effective, yet accurate, assessments of habitat 
      condition, especially in areas protected by statutory conservation measures.
      Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) provide alternatives to manned aircraft and
      walk-over (WO) surveys. To support coastal managers with method selection, we
      compare the costs and benefits of the three techniques using the extent of bait
      collection (sediment scarring from manual digging) on intertidal mudflats from
      three UK sites. UAV and WO surveys were conducted in parallel and aerial
      photography was downloaded from the Channel Coastal Observatory (CCO). Digging
      was digitised from estimations on foot (WO) or by manually labelling imagery with
      confidence assigned (UAV/CCO). Method efficacy is compared with respect to
      spatial coverage, control over survey time/location, spatial resolution,
      positioning accuracy, and area of digging detected. Personnel hours and up-front 
      costs (e.g. training/equipment), costs for personnel time standardised by shore
      area, personnel risk, and environmental impact are also compared. Regarding
      efficacy, CCO imagery had extensive shore coverage compared to UAV and WO,
      however, assessments are restricted to times/locations with available imagery.
      Each method's resolution was sufficient to detect digging. WO achieved the
      highest resolution (on foot), but the lowest positioning accuracy, in contrast to
      accurate feature delineation on aerial imagery. An additive two-way ANOVA
      revealed a significantly higher percent area of 'dug' sediment (all confidence
      levels) recorded by UAV than WO. CCO was the most cost-effective with no
      fieldwork/equipment costs. UAV had the highest up-front costs, but WO was more
      costly for personnel hours/km(2) for survey time and digitisation. For all
      methods, digitisation was the most time-consuming aspect. Compared to WO, UAV
      achieved rapid shore surveys and the CCO and UAV methods minimise personnel
      risks. UAV and WO both cause wildlife disturbance, with trampling an additional
      WO impact. With each method suited to sediment disturbance assessment, selection 
      will depend on resources and objectives and will be aided by this holistic
      cost-benefit analysis. Cost-effectiveness will improve with evolving regulations 
      that facilitate UAV use and technological developments (e.g. machine learning for
      disturbance detection) that could significantly expedite imagery analysis and
      enable broadscale assessments from CCO or satellite imagery.

TI  - Atypical presentation of acanthamoeba keratitis resembling central toxic
      keratopathy.
PG  - 101243
LID - 10.1016/j.ajoc.2021.101243 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To describe an atypical case of acanthamoeba keratitis with positive in 
      vivo confocal microscopy in a non-contact lens user who presented with signs and 
      symptoms suggestive of central toxic keratopathy. OBSERVATIONS: The patient
      presented with bilateral, though sequential, decreased visual acuity with mild
      pain. Examination showed stromal haze with corneal flattening and thinning
      without epithelial defects. Optical coherence tonometry of the right eye revealed
      an inverse dome-shaped appearance of the opacity and in-vivo confocal imaging
      showed double-walled cysts consistent with acanthamoeba. Corneal haze, stromal
      loss, resolved and visual acuity improved over time. CONCLUSION AND IMPORTANCE:
      Acanthamoeba is a rare cause of infectious keratitis that is most often
      associated with contact lens wear in developed countries. Typically, it presents 
      with a unilateral decrease in visual acuity, photophobia, watering, and pain that
      is out of proportion to slit lamp examination findings. However, many atypical
      presentations have been reported in the literature. Consequently, it may be
      misdiagnosed, especially early in the course of the disease. This delay in
      diagnosis can lead to progressive ulceration and visual impairment. In addition, 
      cyst formation can make eradication with anti-amoebic treatment especially
      difficult.Central toxic keratopathy is a non-inflammatory clinical syndrome of
      unknown etiology that is most often associated with excimer laser ablation,
      though other associated causes have been reported. It is characterized by a
      central or paracentral opacity with corneal stromal loss and resultant hyperopic 
      shift. The opacification and stromal loss mostly resolve over the course of
      months with an improvement in visual acuity. This report may help physicians
      broaden their differential and correctly diagnose atypical presentations of
      amoebic infection.

TI  - Comparison of oral metabolome profiles of stimulated saliva, unstimulated saliva,
      and mouth-rinsed water.
PG  - 689
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-04612-x [doi]
AB  - Saliva includes a substantial amount of biological information, which has enabled
      us to understand the relationship between oral metabolites and various oral and
      systemic disorders. However, collecting saliva using a controlled protocol is
      time-consuming, making saliva an unsuitable analyte in large cohort studies.
      Mouth-rinsed water (MW), the water used to rinse the mouth, can be collected
      easily in less time with less difference between subjects than saliva and could
      be used as an alternative in oral metabolome analyses. In this study, we
      investigated the potential of MW collection as an efficient alternative to saliva
      sample collection for oral metabolome profiling. MW, stimulated saliva, and
      unstimulated saliva were collected from 10 systemically healthy participants. The
      samples were subjected to metabolome analysis using capillary electrophoresis
      time-of-flight mass spectrometry, and the types and amounts of metabolites in the
      samples were compared. Qualitatively, MW contained the same metabolites as
      unstimulated and stimulated saliva. While the quantity of the metabolites did not
      drastically change between the sampling methods, all three reflected individual
      differences, and the features of MW were the same as those of the unstimulated
      saliva. Overall, these results suggest that MW may be an appropriate alternative 
      to saliva in oral metabolome profile analysis.

      pre-operative factors affecting final visual outcome was evaluated. RESULTS: A
      total of 791 eyes with OGIs were included in data analysis. 11 eyes that were
      lost to follow-up and 12 eyes with incomplete data were excluded. Most of the
      patients were male (559, 70.6%) and mean age of all patients was 23.9 years +/-
      19.4 years. Occupational hazards (including domestic housework) (307, 38.8%) and 
      leisure play (324, 41.0%) were the leading causes of OGI. The most common
      mechanism of injury was being struck by a wooden stick (250, 31.6%). Univariate
      analysis of pre-operative variables showed initial visual acuity (VA), zone of
      injury, size of wound, structures involved in the injury and presence of
      infection were significant prognostic factors for worse final visual outcome (p <
      0.001). Multivariate analysis showed VA </= 3/60 or worse at presentation had
      statistically significantly higher odds ratio of ending up with worse visual
      outcomes (p < 0.012). CONCLUSIONS: Males in working age groups suffer from OGIs
      more frequently, usually from agricultural and pastoral activities. Initial VA,
      zone 3 injuries, corneoscleral wound, large wound size and presence of
      post-traumatic infections are significant prognostic factors.

AB  - The contagious prion disease "chronic wasting disease" (CWD) infects mule deer
      (Odocoileus hemionus) and related species. Unchecked epidemics raise ecological, 
      socioeconomic, and public health concerns. Prion infection shortens a deer's
      lifespan, and when prevalence (proportion of adults infected) becomes
      sufficiently high CWD can affect herd dynamics. Understanding population
      responses over time is key to forecasting long-term impacts. Here we describe
      unexpected stability in prevalence and abundance in a mule deer herd where CWD
      has been left unmanaged. High apparent prevalence (~30%) since at least 2005
      likely drove observed changes in the proportion and age distribution of wild-type
      native prion protein (PRNP) gene homozygotes among deer sampled. Predation by
      mountain lions (Puma concolor) may be helping keep CWD in check. Despite stable
      appearances, prion disease nonetheless impairs adult survival and likely
      resilience in this deer herd, limiting its potential for growth despite refuge
      from hunter harvest and favorable habitat and winter conditions.

TI  - Ocular Manifestations Of Alkaptonuria
BTI - StatPearls
AB  - Alkaptonuria is a rare autosomal recessive disorder that arises from a mutation
      of the homogentisate 1,2-dioxygenase (HGD) gene, resulting in a deficiency of the
      enzyme HGD.[1] This enzyme plays a role in the phenylalanine and tyrosine
      degradation pathways by catabolizing the tyrosine intermediate metabolite
      homogentisic acid (HGA) into maleylacetoacetic acid (Figure 1).[2] Deficiency of 
      the HGD enzyme results in the abnormal accumulation of upstream precursors HGA,
      tyrosine, and phenylalanine. In particular, the buildup and deposition of HGA is 
      the major contributor to the classic manifestations and consequences of the
      disease, including homogentisic aciduria, ochronosis, and ochronotic
      osteoarthropathy.[2] Alkaptonuria leads to dysfunctions in various tissues
      throughout the body; this article will broadly cover the prominent presentations 
      and focus on ocular manifestations of the disorder in particular. Early
      identification and diagnosis of the disorder are imperative for management and
      treatment as complications can be sight-threatening, including astigmatism,
      central vein occlusion, glaucoma, and blindness.[3] The first case of
      alkaptonuria is believed to have presented in 1500 BC as found in the Egyptian
      mummy Harwa. Biopsy of the body's hip cartilage and intervertebral discs in 1979 
      demonstrated extensive calcification and HGA pigmentation consistent with the
      process of ochronosis.[4] Cases of the disease reported in the 16 century
      centered around the observation of dark urine, which continued to be the
      identifying feature and namesake of the "black urine disease" through the 19
      century. In 1859, Dr. Carl Boedeker found that adding alkali to these patients'
      urine produced the appearance of dark discoloration (later discovered to be due
      to HGA's reducing power). He subsequently named the disease "alkaptonuria" in
      reference to "alkali" in Arabic, meaning "alkali," "alkali" in Greek, meaning "to
      suck up oxygen greedily in alkali," and "alkapton" in German, meaning "a reducing
      compound."[1] Alkaptonuria is a disease that occupies a noteworthy place in the
      histories of biochemistry, genetics, and medicine. In 1902, it was the first
      medical disorder reported to adhere to the Mendelian principles of autosomal
      recessive inheritance by Sir Archibald Garrod. Garrod deduced that all cases of
      alkaptonuria reported at the time required certain genetic contributions from
      both parents. In other words, the spectrum of outward manifestations could all be
      traced back to a specific underlying genetic trait, emphasizing the impact of
      science and genetics on the human constitution. At the time, many debilitating
      diseases were already noted to be more prevalent in consanguineous marriages, but
      few reports addressed consanguinity from a strictly scientific perspective. By
      connecting alkaptonuria to a genetic basis and referring to the similar gametes
      passed on by consanguineous parents, Garrod provided scientific evidence for some
      deleterious effects of consanguineous unions.[2] In his 1908 Croonian Lecture to 
      the Royal College of Physicians, Garrod also later used alkaptonuria as an
      example to demonstrate his concept of "the inborn error of metabolism," now a
      widely used term applied to genetic disorders of innate metabolic pathways such
      as alkaptonuria.[5]

TI  - Approval rates for corneal donation and the origin of donor tissue for
      transplantation at a university-based tertiary referral center with corneal
      subspecialization hosting a LIONS Eye Bank.
PG  - 17
LID - 10.1186/s12886-022-02248-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: With the increasing demand for corneas, eye banks must optimize the
      tissue donation, collection, and selection process. This retrospective
      monocentric study analyzed the approval rates for corneal donation and the origin
      of and reasons for discarding donor corneas from 2010 to 2019. METHODS: Data
      included the number of deceased, approval or rejection by the family for corneal 
      donation and contraindications. Corneal grafts were included from all deceased
      persons who were full-body and multi-organ donors at the Saarland University
      Medical Center (UKS) and from external institutions. Additional analyzed
      parameters included endothelial cell count (ECC), blood sample serology for
      infections, and conjunctival swab testing . RESULTS: A total of 1748
      corneoscleral buttons were harvested from 10,265 deceased persons (17% with no
      contraindication) at the UKS between 2010 and 2019, with a consent rate of 23.3%.
      The number of keratoplasties increased from 136 in 2010 (15% of the deceased,
      total = 925) to 251 in 2019 (21%, total = 1214). Both the general and
      department-specific data showed similar percentages for corneal donation over the
      years, with intensive care and palliative units recently providing the most
      corneas. The increase in the number of corneas processed by the cornea bank over 
      the years (368 in 2010 compared with 857 in 2019) was linked both to a better
      internal supply in 2010 (262, 71.2% of the total) compared with 2019 (519, 60.6%)
      and to an external supply by reinforcement of cooperation with external
      hospitals, including Luxembourg in 2010 (106, 28.8% of the total) compared with
      2019 (338, 39.4%). A total of 195 of 377 corneas (52%) were discarded in 2009
      compared with 260 out of 715 (36%) in 2019. The main reasons for discarding were 
      low ECC (36% of discarded corneas in 2009; 11% in 2019), positive conjunctival
      swab (11% in 2009; 13% in 2019), and blood sample serology (6% in 2009 and in
      2019). CONCLUSION: Despite an increasing number of donors, the demand for corneas
      is still rising. Improved cooperation with internal departments and with external
      clinics has led to an increasing number of explanted corneas. The main reason for
      discarding corneas was low ECC, followed by a positive conjunctival swab for
      fungal or bacterial contamination and serology. Increased donation rates and
      continued improvements in collection and selection processes are necessary to
      cover the high demand for corneas.

TI  - Feature-Based Molecular Networks Identification of Bioactive Metabolites from
      Three Plants of the Polynesian Cosmetopoeia Targeting the Dermal Papilla Cells of
      the Hair Cycle.
LID - 105 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/molecules27010105 [doi]
AB  - The term cosmetopoeia refers to the use of plants in folks' cosmetics. The aerial
      parts of Bidens pilosa L., the leaves of Calophyllum inophyllum L. and the fruits
      of Fagraea berteroana A.Gray ex Benth are traditionally used in French Polynesia 
      for hair and skin care. During the hair cycle, dermal papilla cells and their
      interaction with epithelial cells are essential to promote hair follicle
      elongation. The aim of our investigations was the identification of metabolites
      from these three plants and chemical families responsible for their hair growth
      activity. A bioactivity-based molecular network was produced by mapping the
      correlation between features obtained from LC-MS/MS data and dermal papilla cell 
      proliferation, using the Pearson correlation coefficient. The analyses pointed
      out glycosylated flavonols and phenolic acids from B. pilosa and C. inophyllum,
      along with C-flavonoids, iridoids and secoiridoids from F. berteroana, as
      potential bioactive molecules involved in the proliferation of hair follicle
      dermal papilla cells. Our results highlight the metabolites of the plant species 
      potentially involved in the induction of hair follicle growth and support the
      traditional uses of these plants in hair care.

TI  - Clinical Significance of Stem Cell Biomarkers EpCAM, LGR5 and LGR4 mRNA Levels in
      Lymph Nodes of Colon Cancer Patients.
LID - 403 [pii]

AB  - The significance of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in initiation and progression of
      colon cancer (CC) has been established. In this study, we investigated the
      utility of measuring mRNA expression levels of CSC markers EpCAM, LGR5 and LGR4
      for predicting survival outcome in surgically treated CC patients. Expression
      levels were determined in 5 CC cell lines, 66 primary CC tumors and 382 regional 
      lymph nodes of 121 CC patients. Prognostic relevance was determined using
      Kaplan-Meier survival and Cox regression analyses. CC patients with lymph nodes
      expressing high levels of EpCAM, LGR5 or LGR4 (higher than a clinical cutoff of
      0.07, 0.06 and 2.558 mRNA copies/18S rRNA unit, respectively) had a decreased
      mean survival time of 32 months for EpCAM and 42 months for both LGR5 and LGR4 at
      a 12-year follow-up (p = 0.022, p = 0.005 and p = 0.011, respectively).
      Additional patients at risk for recurrence were detected when LGR5 was combined
      with the biomarkers CXCL17 or CEA plus CXCL16. In conclusion, the study
      underscores LGR5 as a particularly useful prognostic biomarker and illustrates
      the strength of combining biomarkers detecting different subpopulations of cancer
      cells and/or cells in the tumor microenvironment for predicting recurrence.

TI  - P-POSSUM and the NELA Score Overpredict Mortality for Laparoscopic Emergency
      Bowel Surgery: An Analysis of the NELA Database.
PG  - 552-560
LID - 10.1007/s00268-021-06404-w [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Risk stratification has become a key part of the care processes for
      patients having emergency bowel surgery. This study aimed to determine if
      operative approach influences risk-model performance, and risk-adjusted mortality
      rates in the United Kingdom. METHODS: A prospectively planned analysis was
      conducted using National Emergency Laparotomy Audit (NELA) data from December
      2013 to November 2018. The risk-models investigated were P-POSSUM and the NELA
      Score, with model performance assessed in terms of discrimination and
      calibration. Risk-adjusted mortality was assessed using Standardised Mortality
      Ratios (SMR). Analysis was performed for the total cohort, and cases performed
      open, laparoscopically and converted to open. Sub-analysis was performed for
      cases with </= 20% predicted mortality. RESULTS: Data were available for 116 396 
      patients with P-POSSUM predicted mortality, and 46 935 patients with the NELA
      score. Both models displayed excellent discrimination with little variation
      between operative approaches (c-statistic: P-POSSUM 0.801-0.836; NELA Score
      0.811-0.862). The NELA score was well calibrated across all deciles of risk, but 
      P-POSSUM over-predicted risk beyond 20% mortality. Calibration plots for
      operative approach demonstrated that both models increasingly over-predicted
      mortality for laparoscopy, relative to open and converted to open surgery. SMRs
      calculated using both models consistently demonstrated that risk-adjusted
      mortality with laparoscopy was a third lower than open surgery. CONCLUSION:
      Risk-adjusted mortality for emergency bowel surgery is lower for laparoscopy than
      open surgery, with P-POSSUM and NELA score both over-predicting mortality for
      laparoscopy. Operative approach should be considered in the development of future
      risk-models that rely on operative data.

TI  - A Quantitative Approach for Using Anticipatory Behavior as a Graded Welfare
      Assessment.
PG  - 1-15
LID - 10.1080/10888705.2021.2012783 [doi]
AB  - To perform quick assessments, welfare practitioners may focus on specific
      behavioral indicators of welfare, which can lead to challenges in interpretation.
      Anticipatory behavior has been suggested as a potentially graded indicator of
      well-being in animals. However, there are difficulties in assessing variations in
      this class of behavior quantitatively. Here, we propose an analytical approach
      for identifying and comparing the intensity of anticipatory behavior across
      different conditions. We evaluated the changes in the behavior of a sea lion at
      the San Francisco Zoo before and after daily training sessions, the start time of
      which had differing degrees of predictability. We show that anticipatory behavior
      is a complex suite of behaviors that can show multi-directional changes prior to 
      an anticipated event. Additionally, we show that the methods utilized here can
      distinguish among differing intensities of anticipation directed toward daily
      husbandry events. We suggest that this approach may be broadly applicable for
      applying measures of anticipatory behavior as a graded welfare indicator.

TI  - Deep Learning to Detect OCT-derived Diabetic Macular Edema from Color Retinal
      Photographs: A Multicenter Validation Study.
PG  - 398-410
LID - S2468-6530(22)00001-X [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.oret.2021.12.021 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To validate the generalizability of a deep learning system (DLS) that
      detects diabetic macular edema (DME) from 2-dimensional color fundus photographs 
      (CFP), for which the reference standard for retinal thickness and fluid presence 
      is derived from 3-dimensional OCT. DESIGN: Retrospective validation of a DLS
      across international datasets. PARTICIPANTS: Paired CFP and OCT of patients from 
      diabetic retinopathy (DR) screening programs or retina clinics. The DLS was
      developed using data sets from Thailand, the United Kingdom, and the United
      States and validated using 3060 unique eyes from 1582 patients across screening
      populations in Australia, India, and Thailand. The DLS was separately validated
      in 698 eyes from 537 screened patients in the United Kingdom with mild DR and
      suspicion of DME based on CFP. METHODS: The DLS was trained using DME labels from
      OCT. The presence of DME was based on retinal thickening or intraretinal fluid.
      The DLS's performance was compared with expert grades of maculopathy and to a
      previous proof-of-concept version of the DLS. We further simulated the
      integration of the current DLS into an algorithm trained to detect DR from CFP.
      MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The superiority of specificity and noninferiority of
      sensitivity of the DLS for the detection of center-involving DME, using
      device-specific thresholds, compared with experts. RESULTS: The primary analysis 
      in a combined data set spanning Australia, India, and Thailand showed the DLS had
      80% specificity and 81% sensitivity, compared with expert graders, who had 59%
      specificity and 70% sensitivity. Relative to human experts, the DLS had
      significantly higher specificity (P = 0.008) and noninferior sensitivity (P <
      0.001). In the data set from the United Kingdom, the DLS had a specificity of 80%
      (P < 0.001 for specificity of >50%) and a sensitivity of 100% (P = 0.02 for
      sensitivity of > 90%). CONCLUSIONS: The DLS can generalize to multiple
      international populations with an accuracy exceeding that of experts. The
      clinical value of this DLS to reduce false-positive referrals, thus decreasing
      the burden on specialist eye care, warrants a prospective evaluation.

TI  - CLINICAL AND MICROBIOLOGICAL CHARACTERIZATION OF LYMPH NODE ABSCESSATION IN PUP
      AND YEARLING CALIFORNIA SEA LIONS (ZALOPHUS CALIFORNIANUS) UNDERGOING
      REHABILITATION IN A MARINE MAMMAL CENTER.
PG  - 1149-1158
LID - 10.1638/2020-0225 [doi]
AB  - Severe focal to multifocal abscessation of the axillary and inguinal lymph nodes 
      is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in stranded pup and yearling
      California sea lions (Zalophus californianus; CSLs) at The Marine Mammal Center
      (TMMC). A retrospective case review was conducted of all pup and yearling CSLs
      with axillary and/or inguinal lymph node abscesses admitted to this California
      rehabilitation center between January 2015 and December 2019 (n = 162). Clinical 
      data and cultured isolates were evaluated to (1) characterize the clinical
      syndrome, (2) report isolated pathogens, and (3) investigate factors associated
      with clinical outcome (survival to release versus death). Of the 162 CSLs
      admitted with at least one axillary or inguinal lymph node abscess, almost all
      were in poor body condition, and overall mortality rate was 63% (102 of 165).
      Mortality rate was lower for animals presenting with a single abscess and
      abscess(es) in the inguinal location only; odds of death were significantly lower
      for animals that had their abscesses surgically drained (P = 0.029) and those
      that received antimicrobials (P = 0.037). Hematology and serum chemistry
      parameters at the time of abscess diagnosis reflected inflammation and
      malnutrition. Radiographic findings associated with abscesses from 45 cases
      included soft tissue swelling (n = 40), intralesional gas (n = 19), and
      osteomyelitis (n = 3). Ninety bacterial isolates were recovered from aerobic (n =
      48) and anaerobic cultures (n = 17), 48.9% of which were gram negative. The most 
      common gram-negative organisms were Escherichia coli (n = 15), Proteus spp. (n = 
      8), and Bacteroides ureolyticus (n = 7), and the most common gram-positive
      organisms were Streptococcus phocae (n = 10) and Staphylococcus spp. (n = 9).
      Management of lymph node abscesses via surgical drainage and multimodal systemic 
      antimicrobial therapy with a broad-spectrum of activity may be considered to
      improve survival of these cases.

AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the intraocular inflammation after 2 surgical approaches for 
      late in-the-bag intraocular lens (IOL) dislocation. DESIGN: Prospective,
      randomized, parallel-group clinical trial. METHODS: We randomly assigned 100
      patients (100 eyes) referred to Oslo University Hospital (tertiary referral
      center) with late in-the-bag IOL dislocation into IOL repositioning by scleral
      suturing (n=49) or IOL exchange with retropupillary fixation of an iris-claw lens
      (n=51). Patients were examined before surgery and 2 weeks, 6 weeks, and 6 months 
      after surgery. The main outcome measure was anterior chamber laser flare,
      measured with a laser flare meter as photon counts per millisecond (pc/ms).
      RESULTS: Two weeks following surgery, median flare values were 28.9 pc/ms (range,
      7.9-140) in the repositioning group and 31.6 pc/ms (range, 9.8-92.3) in the
      exchange group (P = .83). Flare levels were still elevated after 6 weeks with no 
      difference between the groups (P = .93), whereas it decreased to baseline levels 
      after 6 months. Six weeks following surgery, the central retinal thickness was
      similar (P = .97); cystoid macular edema (CME) was found in 4 and 5 patients,
      respectively (P = .85); and the mean best corrected visual acuity was 0.17 (95%
      CI 0.09, 0.25) and 0.21 (95% CI 0.09, 0.32) logarithm of the minimum angle of
      resolution, respectively (P = .61). CONCLUSIONS: This study revealed similar
      levels of intraocular inflammation following IOL repositioning and IOL exchange. 
      There was no significant difference regarding risk of CME and visual outcome. The
      prolonged elevation in postoperative flare indicates a possible requirement for
      an extended anti-inflammatory treatment period after these operations.

AB  - The ongoing COVID-19 vaccine rollout is critical for reducing SARS-CoV-2
      infections, hospitalizations, and deaths worldwide. Unfortunately, massive
      disparities exist in getting vaccines to vulnerable populations, including people
      living with HIV. Preliminary studies indicate that COVID-19 mRNA vaccines are
      safe and immunogenic in people living with HIV that are virally suppressed with
      potent antiretroviral therapy but may be less efficacious in immunocompromised
      individuals. This raises the concern that COVID-19 vaccines may be less effective
      in resource poor settings with limited access to antiretroviral therapy. Here, we
      evaluated the immunogenicity of a single dose COVID-19 replicon RNA vaccine
      expressing Spike protein (A.1) from SARS-CoV-2 (repRNA-CoV2S) in
      immunocompromised, SIV infected and immune competent, naive pigtail macaques.
      Moderate vaccine-specific cellular Th1 T-cell responses and binding and
      neutralizing antibodies were induced by repRNA-CoV2S in SIV infected animals and 
      naive animals. Furthermore, vaccine immunogenicity was elicited even among the
      animals with the highest SIV viral burden or lowest peripheral CD4 counts prior
      to immunization. This study provides evidence that a SARS-CoV-2 repRNA vaccine
      could be employed to induce strong immunity against COVID-19 in HIV infected and 
      other immunocompromised individuals.

AB  - We report an unusual presentation of presumed mitomycin C toxicity with possible 
      subsequent hypersensitization to other medication toxicities. A 50-year-old
      female presented three months after photorefractive keratectomy with
      intraoperative mitomycin C for the management of persistent epithelial defects,
      corneal haze, and edema. She was found to have used an expansive and rapidly
      changing medical regimen which may have caused additional toxicity. These
      medications included besifloxacin, bromfenac, and ketotifen. Additives such as
      benzalkonium chloride and DuraSite((R)) may have also contributed. Intraoperative
      mitomycin C can result in longstanding corneal haze, edema, and delayed
      epithelial healing in the setting of corneal refractive surgery. These may leave 
      the cornea more susceptible to additional subsequent medication toxicities during
      the postoperative period. This report describes a case of mitomycin C exposure
      leading to a prolonged sensitivity to other medication toxicities, which has not 
      been discussed elsewhere in the literature.

AB  - Since many infected people experience no or few symptoms, the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic
      is frequently monitored through massive virus testing of the population, an
      approach that may be biased and may be difficult to sustain in low-income
      countries. Since SARS-CoV-2 RNA can be detected in stool samples, quantifying
      SARS-CoV-2 genome by RT-qPCR in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) has been
      carried out as a complementary tool to monitor virus circulation among human
      populations. However, measuring SARS-CoV-2 viral load in WWTPs can be affected by
      many experimental and environmental factors. To circumvent these limits, we
      propose here a novel indicator, the wastewater indicator (WWI), that partly
      reduces and corrects the noise associated with the SARS-CoV-2 genome
      quantification in wastewater (average noise reduction of 19%). All data
      processing results in an average correlation gain of 18% with the incidence rate.
      The WWI can take into account the censorship linked to the limit of
      quantification (LOQ), allows the automatic detection of outliers to be integrated
      into the smoothing algorithm, estimates the average measurement error committed
      on the samples and proposes a solution for inter-laboratory normalization in the 
      absence of inter-laboratory assays (ILA). This method has been successfully
      applied in the context of Obepine, a French national network that has been
      quantifying SARS-CoV-2 genome in a representative sample of French WWTPs since
      March 5th 2020. By August 26th, 2021, 168 WWTPs were monitored in the French
      metropolitan and overseas territories of France. We detail the process of
      elaboration of this indicator, show that it is strongly correlated to the
      incidence rate and that the optimal time lag between these two signals is only a 
      few days, making our indicator an efficient complement to the incidence rate.
      This alternative approach may be especially important to evaluate SARS-CoV-2
      dynamics in human populations when the testing rate is low.

AB  - Marine debris, in particular plastic debris and debris related to fishing
      activities, have an impact on marine mammals and seabirds. In marine-coastal
      species such as otariids, we can detect the incidence of these interactions
      through land-based observations. In this study, we recorded and described
      interactions between marine debris and the otariids Arctocephalus australis and
      Otaria byronia in a natural protected area in Peru, according to age class
      categories. Between 2016 and 2020, we recorded 151 animals that were directly
      impacted and/or were observed interacting with marine debris. Residual collars
      from fishing gear, ropes, plastic bags and unidentified material were recorded.
      Direct interactions with debris at colonies (e.g., plastic bags) were also
      recorded, as well as animals evidenced interacting with hooks. The age class
      category and species with the highest number of individuals impacted by residual 
      collars were adult female A. australis and subadult male O. byronia. Single-use
      plastics were the most commonly bitten/moved waste by animals in the reserve. In 
      the case of hooks, these were mostly lodged in the mouths of otariids. Our
      results highlight the importance of continuing to promote segregation at source, 
      as well as the correct disposal of waste, locally and globally, to mitigate
      impacts on marine fauna.

TI  - Incidence and Progression of Myopia in Early Adulthood.
PG  - 162-169
LID - 10.1001/jamaophthalmol.2021.5067 [doi]
AB  - IMPORTANCE: Myopia incidence and progression has been described extensively in
      children. However, few data exist regarding myopia incidence and progression in
      early adulthood. OBJECTIVE: To describe the 8-year incidence of myopia and change
      in ocular biometry in young adults and their association with the known risk
      factors for childhood myopia. DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: The Raine Study 
      is a prospective single-center cohort study. Baseline and follow-up eye
      assessments were conducted from January 2010 to August 2012 and from March 2018
      to March 2020. The data were analyzed from June to July 2021. A total of 1328
      participants attended the baseline assessment, and 813 participants attended the 
      follow-up assessment. Refractive information from both visits was available for
      701 participants. Participants with keratoconus, previous corneal surgery, or
      recent orthokeratology wear were excluded. EXPOSURES: Participants' eyes were
      examined at ages 20 years (baseline) and 28 years. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES:
      Incidence of myopia and high myopia; change in spherical equivalent (SE) and
      axial length (AL). RESULTS: A total of 516 (261 male [50.6%]) and 698 (349 male
      [50.0%]) participants without myopia or high myopia at baseline, respectively,
      were included in the incidences analyses, while 691 participants (339 male [49%])
      were included in the progression analysis. The 8-year myopia and high myopia
      incidence were 14.0% (95% CI, 11.5%-17.4%) and 0.7% (95% CI, 0.3%-1.2%),
      respectively. A myopic shift (of 0.50 diopters [D] or greater in at least 1 eye) 
      occurred in 261 participants (37.8%). Statistical significance was found in
      longitudinal changes in SE (-0.04 D per year; P < .001), AL (0.02 mm per year; P 
      <.001), and lens thickness (0.02 mm per year; P < .001). Incident myopia was
      associated with self-reported East Asian vs White race (odds ratio [OR], 6.13;
      95% CI, 1.06-35.25; P = .04), female vs male sex (OR, 1.81; 95% CI, 1.02-3.22; P 
      = .04), smaller conjunctival ultraviolet autofluorescence area (per 10-mm2
      decrease, indicating less sun exposure; OR, 9.86; 95% CI, 9.76-9.97; P = <.009), 
      and parental myopia (per parent; OR, 1.57; 95% CI, 1.03-2.38; P = <.05). Rates of
      myopia progression and axial elongation were faster in female participants
      (estimate: SE, 0.02 D per year; 95 % CI, 0.01-0.02 and AL, 0.007 mm per year, 95 
      % CI, 0.00.-0.011; P </= .001) and those with parental myopia (estimate per
      parent: SE, 0.01 D per year; 95% CI, 0.00-0.02 and AL, 95% CI, 0.002-0.008; P </=
      .001). Education level was not associated with myopia incidence or progression.
      CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: These findings suggest myopia progression continues
      for more than one-third of adults during the third decade of life, albeit at
      lower rates than during childhood. The protective effects of time outdoors
      against myopia may continue into young adulthood.

TI  - Rapid determination of L-ascorbic acid content in vitamin C serums by
      ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry.
PG  - 131-141
LID - 10.1111/ics.12762 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to develop and validate a rapid, simple, accurate and
      precise analytical method for the quantification of L-AA in vitamin C serums.
      Moreover, the developed method was further applied to determine L-AA in eight
      different brands of vitamin C serums. A complementary study was also carried out 
      to evaluate the stability of L-AA in the vitamin C serum samples after 15, 30, 45
      and 60 days of storage at ambient temperature (15-35 degrees C). METHODS:
      Ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry was
      applied. RESULTS: Quantitative analyses were performed with a total
      chromatographic run time of 1.5 min by matrix-matched calibration, and the
      analytical curve was linear over the range of 1-1700 microg L(-1) with a
      correlation coefficient of 0.9998. The limits of detection (LOD) and
      quantification (LOQ) were 0.3 and 1.0 microg L(-1) , respectively. Intra- and
      inter-assay precisions, expressed in terms of relative standard deviation, ranged
      from 0.3% and 2.2%, respectively, and recoveries in concentration levels of 1 and
      5 microg L(-1) were 103.9% and 101.2%, respectively. The proposed analytical
      method was successfully applied to determine the L-AA content in eight commercial
      vitamin C serum samples. The stability of the target analyte in samples stored at
      ambient temperature (15-35 degrees C) was evaluated throughout 60 days with a
      15-day interval between analyses. At 0 days, L-AA content in samples ranged from 
      1.05 to 169.91 mg L(-1) , which decreases over time. CONCLUSION: The proposed
      method could be powerful in routine analyses to ensure the quantification of L-AA
      in vitamin C serums since it proved to be a simple, reliable, fast, precise,
      accurate and sensitive analytical method.

TI  - Is derived vectorcardiography a potential screening tool for pulmonary
      hypertension?
PG  - 79-83
LID - S0022-0736(21)00300-9 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jelectrocard.2021.12.004 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with atrial septal defects and pulmonary hypertension would 
      benefit from early identification and treatment of pulmonary hypertension prior
      to closure. Noninvasive screening tools for pulmonary hypertension are
      inadequate. Electrocardiography, though readily available, has so far been of
      limited screening utility in patients with pulmonary hypertension. We hypothesize
      that derived vectorcardiographic parameters will aid in identifying increased
      right ventricular afterload and thus provide an additional screening tool for
      pulmonary hypertension in patients with secundum atrial septal defects.
      OBJECTIVE: Establish whether vectorcardiography can be used to screen for
      pulmonary hypertension. METHODS: A retrospective review of patients with secundum
      atrial septal defects (ASD) who underwent cardiac catheterization at the
      University of Minnesota from 2012 to 2020 was performed. We excluded patients
      with other congenital heart diagnoses, insufficient hemodynamic data, or lacking 
      sinus rhythm electrocardiogram at time of cardiac catheterization. Parameters
      analyzed included: Sokolow-Lion right ventricular hypertrophy criteria, PR
      duration, QRS duration, corrected QT intervals, QRS and T wave frontal plane
      axes, rSR', R' amplitude, as well as vectorcardiographic parameters (Kors
      regression-related method), the QRS vector magnitude, T wave vector magnitude,
      and the spatial QRS-T angle. These were compared to measures of pulmonary
      hypertension obtained at cardiac catheterization. RESULTS: The spatial QRS-T
      angle significantly differentiated ASD patients with pulmonary hypertension
      (median 104 degrees, interquartile range 55-137 degrees) from ASD patients
      without pulmonary hypertension (median 37 degrees, interquartile range 21-63
      degrees, p-value of 0.002). At a cut-off of 124 degrees, the positive and
      negative predictive values for identification of pulmonary hypertension were
      36.4% and 96.4%, respectively, with an odds ratio of 13.4 (95% confidence
      interval of 2.9 to 63.7). The positive predictive value was significantly
      improved when combined with echocardiographic data to screen for pulmonary
      hypertension. CONCLUSION: The spatial QRS-T angle is associated with pulmonary
      hypertension in patients with secundum atrial septal defects.

AB  - This study evaluates the diversity of the so-called 'Moroccan Royal lions' using 
      genealogical information. Lions are no longer extant in North Africa, but the
      previous wild population was an important element of the now-recognised northern 
      subspecies (Panthera leo leo) that ranged across West Africa, North Africa and
      the Middle East into India. The remaining captive population of 'Moroccan Royal
      lions' seems to be significantly endangered by the loss of diversity due to the
      effective population size decrease. The pedigree file of this captive lion
      population consisted of 454 individuals, while the reference population included 
      98 animals (47 males and 51 females). The completeness of the pedigree data
      significantly decreased with an increasing number of generations. The highest
      percentage of pedigree completeness (over 70%) was achieved in the first
      generation of the reference population. Pedigree-based parameters derived from
      the common ancestor and gene origin were used to estimate the state of diversity.
      In the reference population, the average inbreeding coefficient was 2.14%, while 
      the individual increase in inbreeding over generations was 2.31%. Overall, the
      reference population showed lower average inbreeding and average relatedness
      compared with the pedigree file. The number of founders (47), the effective
      number of founders (24) and the effective number of ancestors (22) were estimated
      in the reference population. The effective population size of 14.02 individuals
      confirms the critically endangered status of the population and rapid loss of
      diversity in the future. Thus, continuous monitoring of the genetic diversity of 
      the 'Moroccan Royal lion' group is required, especially for long-term
      conservation management purposes, as it would be an important captive group
      should further DNA studies establish an affinity to P. leo leo.

      Elastomers Based on Their Swelling Behavior.

LID - 10.3390/polym13244402 [doi]
AB  - The present study investigates different elastomers with regard to their behavior
      towards liquids such as moisture, fuels, or fuel components. First, four
      additively manufactured materials are examined in detail with respect to their
      swelling in the fuel component toluene as well as in water. The chemical nature
      of the materials is elucidated by means of infrared spectroscopy. The
      experimentally derived absorption curves of the materials in the liquids are
      described mathematically using Fick's diffusion law. The mechanical behavior is
      determined by uniaxial tensile tests, which are evaluated on the basis of stress 
      and strain at break. The results of the study allow for deriving valuable
      recommendations regarding the printing process and postprocessing. Second, this
      article investigates the swelling behavior of new as well as thermo-oxidatively
      aged elastomers in synthetic fuels. For this purpose, an analysis routine is
      presented using sorption experiments combined with gas chromatography and mass
      spectrometry and is thus capable of analyzing the swelling behavior
      multifacetted. The transition of elastomer constituents into the surrounding fuel
      at different aging and sorption times is determined precisely. The change in
      mechanical properties is quantified using density measurements, micro Shore A
      hardness measurements, and the parameters stress and strain at break from
      uniaxial tensile tests.

      subjects consuming beverages immediately before testing.
PG  - 010902
LID - 10.11613/BM.2022.010902 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: In previous research projects and clinical settings, alcohol
      analysis in oral fluid (saliva) has been used as an alternative to breath or
      blood alcohol testing. In this study we examined whether it is possible to obtain
      clinically relevant data regarding alcohol consumption in individuals who
      recently consumed alcohol by analysing oral fluid samples when the recommended
      rinsing of the mouth is impossible before sample collection. MATERIALS AND
      METHODS: We conducted a study of 89 nightclub patrons in Norway. Before
      collecting oral fluid samples and performing breath alcohol testing, participants
      were required to drink a glass of water to remove residual alcohol from the
      mouth. Oral fluid samples were collected with the Quantisal oral fluid collection
      device and analysed using an enzymatic method for alcohol. The alcohol
      concentration in the neat (undiluted) oral fluid was then calculated. Breath
      alcohol testing was performed using Lion Alcolmeter 500 instruments. RESULTS: No 
      false-negative or false-positive results for alcohol were detected in the oral
      fluid when compared with those in the breath. The Intraclass Correlation
      Coefficient of 0.40 indicated a poor correlation between alcohol concentrations
      in the two sample types. CONCLUSIONS: The procedure for collecting oral fluid was
      suitable for the qualitative determination of alcohol intake but not for
      quantitative assessment. We recommend that oral fluid samples should not be used 
      for estimating blood or breath alcohol concentrations in people who have recently
      consumed alcohol or non-alcoholic beverages, as recommended in the instructions
      for use.

TI  - Geant4 Monte Carlo simulation study of the secondary radiation fields at the
      laser-driven ion source LION.
PG  - 24418
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-03897-2 [doi]
AB  - At the Center for Advanced Laser Applications (CALA), Garching, Germany, the LION
      (Laser-driven ION Acceleration) experiment is being commissioned, aiming at the
      production of laser-driven bunches of protons and light ions with multi-MeV
      energies and repetition frequency up to 1 Hz. A Geant4 Monte Carlo-based study of
      the secondary neutron and photon fields expected during LION's different
      commissioning phases is presented. Goal of this study is the characterization of 
      the secondary radiation environment present inside and outside the LION cave.
      Three different primary proton spectra, taken from experimental results reported 
      in the literature and representative of three different future stages of the
      LION's commissioning path are used. Together with protons, also electrons are
      emitted through laser-target interaction and are also responsible for the
      production of secondary radiation. For the electron component of the three source
      terms, a simplified exponential model is used. Moreover, in order to reduce the
      simulation complexity, a two-components simplified geometrical model of proton
      and electron sources is proposed. It has been found that the radiation
      environment inside the experimental cave is either dominated by photons or
      neutrons depending on the position in the room and the source term used. The
      higher the intensity of the source, the higher the neutron contribution to the
      total dose for all scored positions. Maximum neutron and photon ambient dose
      equivalent values normalized to 10(9) simulated incident primaries were
      calculated at the exit of the vacuum chamber, where values of about 85 nSv (10(9)
      primaries)(-1) and 1.0 muSv (10(9) primaries)(-1) were found.

AB  - Southern sea otters (SSO: Enhydra lutris nereis) are a federally-listed
      threatened subspecies found almost exclusively in California, USA. Despite their 
      zoonotic potential and lack of host specificity, K. pneumoniae and Klebsiella
      spp. have largely unknown epizootiology in SSOs. Klebsiella pneumoniae is
      occasionally isolated at necropsy, but not from live SSOs. Hypermucoviscous (HMV)
      K. pneumoniae strains are confirmed pathogens of Pacific Basin pinnipeds, but
      have not been previously isolated from SSOs. We characterized the virulence
      profiles of K. pneumoniae isolates from necropsied SSOs, evaluated killing of
      marine mammal K. pneumoniae following in vitro exposure to California sea lion
      (CSL: Zalophanus californianus) whole blood and serum, and characterized lesion
      patterns associated with Klebsiella spp. infection in SSOs. Four of 15 SSO K.
      pneumoniae isolates were HMV and all were recovered from SSOs that stranded
      during 2005. Many K. pneumoniae infections were associated with moderate to
      severe pathology as a cause of death or sequela. All HMV infections were assessed
      as a primary cause of death or as a direct result of the primary cause of death. 
      Klebsiella-infected SSOs exhibited bronchopneumonia, tracheobronchitis and/or
      pleuritis, enteritis, Profilicollis sp. acanthocephalan peritonitis, septic
      peritonitis, and septicemia. All SSO HMV isolates were capsular type K2, the
      serotype most associated with HMV infections in CSLs. Multiplex PCR revealed two 
      distinct virulence gene profiles within HMV isolates and two within non-HMV
      isolates. In vitro experiments investigating CSL whole blood and serum killing of
      K. pneumoniae suggest that HMV isolates are more resistant to serum killing than 
      non-HMV isolates.

AB  - Despite the propensity for complex and non-equilibrium dynamics in nature,
      eco-evolutionary analytical theory typically assumes that populations are at
      equilibria. In particular, pathogens often show antigenic escape from host immune
      defences, leading to repeated epidemics, fluctuating selection and
      diversification, but we do not understand how this impacts the evolution of
      virulence. We model the impact of antigenic drift and escape on the evolution of 
      virulence in a generalized pathogen and apply a recently introduced oligomorphic 
      methodology that captures the dynamics of the mean and variance of traits, to
      show analytically that these non-equilibrium dynamics select for the long-term
      persistence of more acute pathogens with higher virulence. Our analysis predicts 
      both the timings and outcomes of antigenic shifts leading to repeated epidemics
      and predicts the increase in variation in both antigenicity and virulence before 
      antigenic escape. There is considerable variation in the degree of antigenic
      escape that occurs across pathogens and our results may help to explain the
      difference in virulence between related pathogens including, potentially, human
      influenzas. Furthermore, it follows that these pathogens will have a lower R0,
      with clear implications for epidemic behaviour, endemic behaviour and control.
      More generally, our results show the importance of examining the evolutionary
      consequences of non-equilibrium dynamics.

AB  - Reported growth rates (GR) of atrophic lesions in Stargardt disease (STGD1) vary 
      widely. In the present study, we report the longitudinal natural history of
      patients with confirmed biallelic ABCA4 mutations from five genotype groups:
      c.6079C>T, c.[2588G>C;5603A>T], c.3113C>T, c.5882G>A and c.5603A>T. Fundus
      autofluorescence (AF) 30 degrees x 30 degrees images were manually segmented for 
      boundaries of definitely decreased autofluorescence (DDAF). The primary outcome
      was the effective radius GR across five genotype groups. The age of DDAF
      formation in each eye was calculated using the x-intercept of the DDAF effective 
      radius against age. Discordance between age at DDAF formation and symptom onset
      was compared. A total of 75 eyes from 39 STGD1 patients (17 male [44%]; mean +/- 
      SD age 45 +/- 19 years; range 21-86) were recruited. Patients with c.3113C>T or
      c.6079C>T had a significantly faster effective radius GR at 0.17 mm/year (95% CI 
      0.12 to 0.22; p < 0.001 and 0.14 to 0.21; p < 0.001) respectively, as compared to
      those patients harbouring c.5882G>A at 0.06 mm/year (95% CI 0.03-0.09),
      respectively. Future clinical trial design should consider the effect of genotype
      on the effective radius GR and the timing of DDAF formation relative to symptom
      onset.

TI  - The Experiences of People with Dementia and Informal Carers Related to the
      Closure of Social and Medical Services in Poland during the COVID-19 Pandemic-A
      Qualitative Study.
LID - 1677 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/healthcare9121677 [doi]
AB  - Older people with dementia are particularly at risk of COVID-19; however,
      relatively little is known about the indirect impact of the pandemic on the lives
      of those living with, and/or caring for someone with, dementia. The aim of this
      study was to investigate the experiences of people with dementia and informal
      carers during the closure of available social and medical services in Poland
      during the COVID-19 pandemic. A qualitative thematic analysis of semi-structured 
      interviews with people with dementia (n = 5) and informal carers (n = 21) was
      performed between June and August 2020 after the first wave of COVID-19 in
      Poland. Three overarching themes were identified: (1) care re-organization; (2)
      psychological responses; (3) emerging needs. The factor underlying all these
      elements was reliance on other people. Social support and engagement are vital to
      the ongoing health and well-being of people living with dementia and their
      informal carers. Services need to be strengthened to provide ongoing provision to
      those living with dementia to reach pre-pandemic levels, if not better. Within
      the post-pandemic environment, people with dementia and their informal carers
      need reassurance that they can rely on external institutional and social support 
      able to meet their needs.

TI  - The Maternal Milk Microbiome in Mammals of Different Types and Its Potential Role
      in the Neonatal Gut Microbiota Composition.
LID - 3349 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ani11123349 [doi]
AB  - Maternal milk, a main source of nutrition for neonates in early life, has
      attracted attention. An increasing number of studies have found that maternal
      milk has a high microbial diversity, as well as factors that might influence this
      diversity. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the effects of host
      diet and phylogeny on maternal milk microbes and the contribution of the maternal
      milk microbiota to the neonatal gut microbiota. Here, we analyzed the maternal
      milk and fecal microbiota of nine species (lion, dog, panda, human, mouse, rhesus
      macaque, cow, goat, and rabbit) of mammals of three type groups (herbivore,
      omnivore, and carnivore) using 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing. Our study provided
      evidence of host diet and phylogeny on the maternal milk microbiota. Moreover,
      functional prediction revealed that the carnivores had a significantly higher
      percentage of base excision repair, glycerolipid metabolism, taurine and
      hypotaurine metabolism, inorganic ion transport and metabolism, and nucleotide
      metabolism; while arginine and proline metabolism showed enrichment in the
      herbivore group. Source-tracking analysis showed that the contributions of
      bacteria from maternal milk to the microbiota of neonates of different mammals
      were different at day 3 after neonatal birth. Overall, our findings provided a
      theoretical basis for the maternal milk microbiota to affect neonatal fecal
      microbiota at day 3 after neonatal birth.

AB  - AIMS: Glioneuronal tumours, although rare, are an important cause of
      treatment-resistant epilepsy. Differential diagnosis of glioneuronal tumour
      subtypes is complicated by their variable histological appearance and the lack of
      pathognomonic histological or molecular biomarkers. In this study we have applied
      techniques available in a diagnostic laboratory setting to characterise molecular
      and cytogenetic abnormalities in a single institution cohort of glioneuronal
      tumours. METHODS: A cohort of 29 glioneuronal tumours that included 21
      gangliogliomas and 5 dysembryoplastic neuroepithelial tumours (DNETs) was
      analysed using low pass whole genome sequencing (WGS) and 2 multiplex
      ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) central nervous system (CNS) tumour
      probesets. RESULTS: Low pass WGS identified chromosomal or subchromosomal
      alterations in 15 specimens. The most common chromosomal alterations were gains
      of chromosome 7 (n = 8) and chromosome 16 (n = 3). The BRAF(V600E) mutation was
      detected by MLPA in 9/21 (42.9%) gangliogliomas and 2/2 pleomorphic
      xanthoastrocytomas (PXAs). Chromosome 7 gains detected by WGS were reflected in
      MLPAs by overall gains of chromosome 7 gene probes, including those for BRAF,
      KIAA1549 and EGFR, while an internal BRAF/MKRN1 duplication was detected in a
      single ganglioglioma. Homozygous CDKN2A/B loss was detected by MLPA in 3
      gangliogliomas, with p16 immunohistochemistry supporting these results.
      CONCLUSIONS: The combination of low pass WGS and MLPA identifies multiple,
      diverse genetic and chromosomal alterations in glioneuronal tumours, irrespective
      of histological tumour grade.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether a community health worker (CHW) program increases
      referrals to local eye care providers and ultimately reduces the incidence of
      corneal ulcers. DESIGN: Cluster-randomized trial performed from 2014 to 2017 in
      rural South India. METHODS: This was a community-based study that included all
      inhabitants of 42 rural South Indian communities. CHWs were trained to diagnose
      corneal abrasions and assist participants in seeking care at a local vision
      center. Given the nature of the intervention, the trial was not masked. The main 
      outcome measure was incident corneal ulcer, defined as an active infiltrate or
      evidence of a new opacity, as assessed by means of penlight examination during an
      annual door-to-door census. RESULTS: Twenty-one study clusters were randomized to
      the CHW intervention and 21 to no intervention. Vision centers diagnosed 195
      corneal abrasions from the intervention clusters during the 2-year study (rate,
      223 per 100,000 person-years; 95% CI, 28-1743) and 62 from the control clusters
      (rate, 62 per 100,000 person-years; 95% CI, 8-496; incidence rate ratio, 3.57;
      95% CI, 2.01-6.35; P < .001). The estimated incidence of corneal ulceration
      during the study period was 60 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 25-141) in the
      intervention group and 32 per 100,000 person-years (95% CI, 13-80) in the control
      group (incidence rate ratio, 1.86; 95% CI, 0.5-6.4; P = .32). CONCLUSIONS: A CHW 
      program resulted in 3.5 times more referrals to local eye care providers for
      corneal abrasions, but no difference could be detected in the incidence of
      corneal ulceration. CHW programs provide a mechanism for increasing referrals to 
      eye hospitals. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT02284698.

AB  - Carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma (CEPA) of the lacrimal gland is a rare malignant
      tumor that arises from a pre-existing pleomorphic adenoma. Lacrimal gland CEPA
      with mucoepidermoid histological subtype is exceedingly rare. Diagnosis can be
      aided by radiographic findings, though the gold standard is histopathological
      analysis following excisional biopsy. Management options include complete
      surgical excision with or without adjuvant radiation therapy based on tumor grade
      and invasiveness. We present a 76-year-old woman with 6 months of diplopia and
      unilateral proptosis. Her initial exam was remarkable for hypoglobus, proptosis, 
      and limited elevation of the right eye. Computed tomography (CT) scan
      demonstrated a superior, well-circumscribed, extraconal orbital mass. An
      excisional biopsy was performed, and histopathological findings were consistent
      with mucoepidermoid carcinoma ex pleomorphic adenoma with positive margins in the
      tumor capsule. The patient received radiation therapy and remains markedly
      improved with no disease recurrence at 5 months post-operatively.

TI  - Environmental factors influencing spotted hyena and lion population biomass
      across Africa.
PG  - 17219-17237
LID - 10.1002/ece3.8359 [doi]
AB  - The spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta Erxleben) and the lion (Panthera leo Linnaeus)
      are two of the most abundant and charismatic large mammalian carnivores in Africa
      and yet both are experiencing declining populations and significant pressures
      from environmental change. However, with few exceptions, most studies have
      focused on influences upon spotted hyena and lion populations within individual
      sites, rather than synthesizing data from multiple locations. This has impeded
      the identification of over-arching trends behind the changing biomass of these
      large predators. Using partial least squares regression models, influences upon
      population biomass were therefore investigated, focusing upon prey biomass,
      temperature, precipitation, and vegetation cover. Additionally, as both species
      are in competition with one other for food, the influence of competition and
      evidence of environmental partitioning were assessed. Our results indicate that
      spotted hyena biomass is more strongly influenced by environmental conditions
      than lion, with larger hyena populations in areas with warmer winters, cooler
      summers, less drought, and more semi-open vegetation cover. Competition was found
      to have a negligible influence upon spotted hyena and lion populations, and
      environmental partitioning is suggested, with spotted hyena population biomass
      greater in areas with more semi-open vegetation cover. Moreover, spotted hyena is
      most heavily influenced by the availability of medium-sized prey biomass, whereas
      lion is influenced more by large size prey biomass. Given the influences
      identified upon spotted hyena populations in particular, the results of this
      study could be used to highlight populations potentially at greatest risk of
      decline, such as in areas with warming summers and increasingly arid conditions.

TI  - Enhanced Pathogenesis Caused by Influenza D Virus and Mycoplasma bovis
      Coinfection in Calves: a Disease Severity Linked with Overexpression of IFN-gamma
      as a Key Player of the Enhanced Innate Immune Response in Lungs.
PG  - e0169021
LID - 10.1128/spectrum.01690-21 [doi]
AB  - Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is a major disease of young cattle whose
      etiology lies in complex interactions between pathogens and environmental and
      host factors. Despite a high frequency of codetection of respiratory pathogens in
      BRD, data on the molecular mechanisms and pathogenesis associated with viral and 
      bacterial interactions are still limited. In this study, we investigated the
      effects of a coinfection with influenza D virus (IDV) and Mycoplasma bovis in
      cattle. Naive calves were infected by aerosol with a French IDV strain and an M. 
      bovis strain. The combined infection shortened the incubation period, worsened
      the disease, and led to more severe macroscopic and microscopic lesions compared 
      to these parameters in calves infected with only one pathogen. In addition, IDV
      promoted colonization of the lower respiratory tract (LRT) by M. bovis and
      increased white cell recruitment to the airway lumen. The transcriptomic analysis
      highlighted an upregulation of immune genes in the lungs of coinfected calves.
      The gamma interferon (IFN-gamma) gene was shown to be the gene most statistically
      overexpressed after coinfection at 2 days postinfection (dpi) and at least until 
      7 dpi, which correlated with the high level of lymphocytes in the LRT.
      Downregulation of the PACE4 and TMPRSS2 endoprotease genes was also highlighted, 
      being a possible reason for the faster clearance of IDV in the lungs of
      coinfected animals. Taken together, our coinfection model with two respiratory
      pathogens that when present alone induce moderate clinical signs of disease was
      shown to increase the severity of the disease in young cattle and a strong
      transcriptomic innate immune response in the LRT, especially for IFN-gamma.
      IMPORTANCE Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) is among the most prevalent diseases 
      in young cattle. BRD is due to complex interactions between viruses and/or
      bacteria, most of which have a moderate individual pathogenicity. In this study, 
      we showed that coinfection with influenza D virus (IDV) and Mycoplasma bovis
      increased the severity of the respiratory disease in calves in comparison with
      IDV or M. bovis infection. IDV promoted M. bovis colonization of the lower
      respiratory tract and increased white cell recruitment to the airway lumen. The
      transcriptomic analysis highlighted an upregulation of immune genes in the lungs 
      of coinfected calves. The IFN-gamma gene in particular was highly overexpressed
      after coinfection, correlated with the disease severity, immune response, and
      white cell recruitment in the lungs. In conclusion, we showed that IDV
      facilitates coinfections within the BRD complex by modulating the local innate
      immune response, providing new insights into the mechanisms involved in severe
      respiratory diseases.

TI  - Immunological alterations after immunotherapy with short lived HBV-TCR T cells
      associates with long-term treatment response in HBV-HCC.
PG  - 841-854

AB  - The application of hepatitis B virus (HBV)-T-cell receptor (TCR) T-cell
      immunotherapy in patients with HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-HCC) has
      been apathetic, as the expression of HBV antigens by both normal HBV-infected
      hepatocytes and HCC cells with HBV-DNA integration increases the risk of
      on-target off-tumor severe liver inflammatory events. To increase the safety of
      this immunotherapeutic approach, we developed messenger RNA (mRNA)
      HBV-TCR-redirected T cells that-due to the transient nature of mRNA-are
      functionally short lived and can be infused in escalating doses. The safety of
      this approach and its clinical potential against primary HBV-HCC have never been 
      analyzed in human trials; thus, we studied the clinical and immunological
      parameters of 8 patients with chronic HBV infection and diffuse nonoperable
      HBV-HCC treated at weekly intervals with escalating doses (1 x 10(4) , 1 x 10(5) 
      , 1 x 10(6) , and 5 x 10(6) TCR+ T cells/kg body weight) of T cells modified with
      HBV-TCR encoding mRNA. The treatment was well tolerated with no severe systemic
      inflammatory events, cytokine storm, or neurotoxicity observed in any of these
      patients throughout treatment. Instead, we observed a destruction of the tumor
      lesion or a prolonged stable disease in 3 of 8 patients. Importantly, the
      patients without clinically relevant reductions of HCC did not display any
      detectable peripheral blood immunological alterations. In contrast, signs of
      transient localized liver inflammation, activation of the T-cell compartment,
      and/or elevations of serum chemokine (C-X-C motif) ligand (CXCL) 9 and CXCL10
      levels were detected in patients with long-term clinical benefit. Conclusion: We 
      show that despite the reduced in vivo half-life (3-4 days), adoptive transfer of 
      mRNA HBV-TCR T cells into patients with HBV-HCC show long-term clinical benefit
      that was associated with transient immunological alterations.

TI  - A One Year Longitudinal Comparative Analysis of Visual Outcomes Between
      Femtosecond Laser-Assisted Cataract Surgery and Standard Phacoemulsification
      Cataract Surgery.
PG  - 4667-4680
LID - 10.2147/OPTH.S336356 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To assess visual outcomes over time of femtosecond laser-assisted
      cataract surgery compared to standard phacoemulsification cataract surgery.
      DESIGN: A retrospective, single-center comparative study. METHODS: Patient data
      including demographics, ocular biometry, pre- and postoperative visual acuity,
      postoperative complications, primary (uncorrected distance visual acuity over
      time) and secondary visual outcomes (uncorrected near visual acuity, best
      distance visual acuity, patient complaints, satisfaction, and postoperative
      surgery) were gathered and statistically analyzed. Demographic differences
      between patients receiving femtosecond-laser assisted cataract surgery (FLACS)
      versus standard phacoemulsification cataract surgery (PCS) were corrected for
      outcome comparison. Safety, efficacy, predictability, and stability were analyzed
      for each procedure and compared. RESULTS: A total of 155 eyes in PCS and 143 eyes
      in FLACS were analyzed at 1 week, 3 months, and 1 year using odds ratio. The odds
      ratio of being 20/20 or better and 20/40 or better at the specified time periods 
      were similar and statistically insignificant at all time periods analyzed except 
      20/20 or better for uncorrected distance visual acuity (UDVA) at 1 year
      (p=0.0001) and uncorrected near visual acuity (UNVA) at 1 week (p=0.02). In both 
      cases, the odds of being 20/20 or better favored FLACS. Mean UDVA, UNVA, and best
      distance visual acuity (BDVA) were all similar and statistically insignificant
      between the two groups. Postoperative patient complaints, safety, efficacy,
      predictability, and stability between the two groups showed no statistical
      significance. CONCLUSION: Despite the odds ratio of being 20/20 or better
      favoring FLACS for UDVA at 1 year and UNVA at 1 week, the mean logMAR UDVA, BDVA,
      and UNVA were similar and statistically insignificant between the FLACS and PCS
      groups at 1 week, 3 months, and 1 year. Differences in visual acuity were likely 
      due to differences other than surgical approaches. While both FLACS and PCS are
      appropriate approaches to cataract surgery, one does not appear to be superior
      when assessing longitudinal markers for visual acuity, safety, efficacy,
      predictability and stability.

TI  - The 2018 Global Point Prevalence Survey of antimicrobial consumption and
      resistance in 47 Canadian hospitals: a cross-sectional survey.
PG  - E1242-E1251
LID - 10.9778/cmajo.20200274 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patient-level surveillance of antimicrobial use (AMU) in Canadian
      hospitals empowers the reduction of inappropriate AMU and was piloted in 2017
      among 14 hospitals in Canada. We aimed to describe AMU on the basis of
      patient-level data in Canadian hospitals in 2018 in terms of antimicrobial
      prescribing prevalence and proportions, antimicrobial indications, and agent
      selection in medical, surgical and intensive care wards. METHODS: Canadian adult,
      pediatric and neonatal hospitals were invited to participate in the standardized 
      web-based cross-sectional Global Point Prevalence Survey of Antimicrobial
      Consumption and Resistance (Global-PPS) conducted in 2018. An identified site
      administrator assigned all wards admitting inpatients to specific surveyors. A
      physician, pharmacist or nurse with infectious disease training performed the
      survey. The primary outcomes were point prevalence rates for AMU over the study
      period regarding prescriptions, indications and agent selection in medical,
      surgical and intensive care wards. The secondary outcomes were AMU for resistant 
      organisms and practice appropriateness evaluated on the basis of quality
      indicators. Antimicrobial consumption is presented in terms of prevalence and
      proportions. RESULTS: Forty-seven of 118 (39.8%) hospitals participated in the
      survey; 9 hospitals were primary care centres, 15 were secondary care centres and
      23 were tertiary or specialized care centres. Of 13 272 patients included, 33.5% 
      (n = 4447) received a total of 6525 antimicrobials. Overall, 74.1% (4832/6525) of
      antimicrobials were for therapeutic use, 12.6% (n = 825) were for medical
      prophylaxis, 8.9% (n = 578) were for surgical prophylaxis, 2.2% (n = 143) were
      for other use and 2.3% (n = 147) were for unidentified reasons. A diagnosis or
      indication was documented in the patient's file at the initiation for 87.3% (n = 
      5699) of antimicrobials; 62.9% (n = 4106) of antimicrobials had a stop or review 
      date; and 72.0% (n = 4697) of prescriptions were guided by local guidelines.
      INTERPRETATION: Overall, three-quarters of AMU was for therapeutic use across
      participating hospitals. Canadian hospitals should be further incentivized to
      create and adapt local guidelines on the basis of recent antimicrobial resistance
      data.

AB  - Intense research on nanocrystals synthesized in solution is motivated by their
      original physical properties, which are determined by their sizes and shapes on
      various scales. However, morphology control on the nanoscale is limited by our
      understanding of crystallization, which is challenged by the now well-established
      prevalence of noncrystalline intermediates. In particular, the impact of such
      intermediates on the final sizes and crystal quality remains unclear because the 
      characterization of their evolution on the nanometer and millisecond scales with 
      nonperturbative analyses has remained a challenge. Here we use in situ X-ray
      scattering to show that the nucleation and growth of YVO4:Eu nanocrystals is
      spatially restrained within amorphous, nanometer-scaled intermediates. The
      reactivity and size of these amorphous intermediates determine (i) the mono
      versus polycrystalline character of final crystals and (ii) the size of final
      crystals. This implies that designing amorphous intermediates themselves that
      form in <6 ms is one of the keys to controlled bottom-up syntheses of optimized
      nanoparticles.

TI  - An unusual manifestation of hydatid disease: A case in a 20-year old male
      patient.
PG  - e01359
LID - 10.1016/j.idcr.2021.e01359 [doi]
AB  - Echinococcosis is a re-emerging public health issue in developing countries as
      most communities are homes to dogs and other domesticated animals while cattle
      raising is a major habit of most sub-Saharan countries. The usual presentations
      include liver and lung cysts. While few documentations and publications have been
      made on extra-pulmonary intrathoracic hydatid cysts in other parts of the world, 
      there has been no published document on extra-pulmonary intrathoracic hydatid
      cysts consisting of eighty or more cystic masses in a single patient in Ethiopia.
      We present a case of right sided extra-pulmonary intrathoracic hydatid cysts in a
      20-year old Ethiopian male patient with compressive respiratory symptoms and
      significant social history of cohabiting with dogs throughout childhood. The
      patient was treated by surgery via a posterolateral thoracotomy and had a smooth 
      Post-operative course and discharged home on postoperative day 15 on albendazole 
      and analgesics. Intraoperative findings included approximately 1500 ml of cystic 
      fluid, eighty cystic masses and collapsed lung.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: People who survive after primary cancer are at an increased risk for 
      subsequent primary cancers. We aimed to investigate the possible determinants of 
      second primary cancer (SPC) in HIV-positive cancer survivors. METHODS: This was a
      multicenter retrospective study using longitudinal data from the French Dat'AIDS 
      cohort. Subjects who developed at least 2 primary cancers were selected. Cancer
      cases were identified using ICD10 codes and distributed in 3 cancer categories:
      AIDS-defining cancer (ADC), virus-related non-ADC (VR-NADC), and
      virus-unrelated-NADC (VU-NADC). The possible determinants considered were the
      first primary cancer category, sex, age, HIV transmission route, duration of HIV 
      infection follow-up, duration of ART exposure, nadir CD4(+) T cell count, and
      hepatitis C and hepatitis B serostatus. RESULTS: Among the 44642 patients in the 
      Dat'AIDS cohort, 4855 were diagnosed with cancer between 1 December 1983 and 31
      December 2015, of whom 444 (9.1%) developed at least 2 primary cancers: 130 ADCs,
      85 VR-NADCs, and 229 VU-NADCs. A longer delay between the first primary cancer
      and the SPC was associated with an increased risk of occurrence of a VR-NADC
      rather than a secondary ADC. Having had a first primary VU-NADC, an older age,
      and a longer delay between the HIV diagnosis and the first primary cancer as well
      as between the first primary cancer and the SPC were associated with an increased
      risk of VU-NADC rather than ADC. CONCLUSION: SPCs are now a major concern in
      HIV-positive cancer survivors justifying the development of monitoring strategies
      after a first cancer.

AB  - Volatile pollutants from former industrial sites can degrade the buildings'
      indoor air quality that were built after the industrial activities. Since 2010,
      environmental assessments have been conducted in French establishments hosting
      sensitive populations identified as being on or near potentially contaminated
      former industrial sites. These projects are based on historical studies
      traditionally carried out as part of managing contaminated sites, to determine
      which substances should be analyzed. They pinpoint former activities likely to
      have stored or used pollutants. We show that the historical information collected
      is not effective in targeting sites with increased probability of mercury being
      present in soil gases. Environmental history has demonstrated the existence of
      large-scale artisanal contamination, both prior to and concomitant with the
      industrial era. Classic historical studies would not take into account artisanal 
      activities, which are less documented than industrial activities. We carried out 
      additional research for three schools located in three different Parisian
      districts. Although information on activities which could have emitted mercury
      was relatively imprecise (in terms of location, type and duration of activities) 
      and uncertainties exist about the completeness of the archival documents
      available, our investigations identified several mercury-using activities that
      had not been identified during the classic historical study. However, we have
      shown that the number of activities identified does not provide information on
      how mercury has affected soil gas. Consequently, although a more extensive
      historical research improves knowledge about the presence of potential
      mercury-using activities, our study shows that a systematic analysis of mercury
      as part of the assessment of establishments hosting sensitive populations remains
      relevant. This approach should be applied to other cities around the world.

TI  - Interprofessional spiritual care education in pediatric hematology-oncology: A
      pilot study.
PG  - e29515
LID - 10.1002/pbc.29515 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Evidence and clinical guidelines call care team members to address
      the spiritual well-being of pediatric patients, especially adolescents and young 
      adults (AYA), with cancer and blood disorders. However, the lack of relevant
      training in generalist spiritual care has been a key barrier. Therefore, we aimed
      to improve clinicians' capabilities by utilizing the Interprofessional Spiritual 
      Care Education Curriculum (ISPEC) to close this gap in pediatric
      hematology-oncology. A model of interprofessional spiritual care entails that all
      team members attend to patients' spirituality by employing generalist spiritual
      care skills and collaborating with spiritual care specialists such as chaplains. 
      METHODS: Interdisciplinary team members providing care for AYA with cancer and
      blood disorders were recruited to participate in interprofessional spiritual care
      education. Our intervention combined an evidence-based online curriculum and
      in-person discussion groups. Pretest-posttest study examined changes in
      participants' skills and practices to identify, address, and discuss spiritual
      concerns. Surveys were conducted at baseline and at 1, 3, and 6 months after the 
      intervention. RESULTS: Participants (n = 21) included physicians, advanced
      practice providers, nurse coordinators, and psychosocial team members. We
      observed positive changes in participants' ability (36%, P < 0.01), frequency
      (56%, P = 0.01), confidence (32%, P < 0.01), and comfort (31%, P = 0.02)
      providing generalist spiritual care baseline versus one month, with significant
      gains maintained through six months (Omnibus P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Utilizing
      ISPEC, interprofessional spiritual care education has a strong potential to
      develop pediatric hematology-oncology team members' capabilities to attend to the
      spiritual aspect of whole-person care and thus contribute to the well-being of
      AYA with cancer and blood disorders.

TI  - A cross-sectional study of relationships between periodontal disease and general 
      health: The Hitachi Oral Healthcare Survey.
PG  - 644
LID - 10.1186/s12903-021-01990-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: This cross-sectional study performed to clarify the relationship
      between periodontal disease and non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as
      obesity, diabetes mellitus, impaired glucose tolerance (IGT), chronic obstructive
      pulmonary disease (COPD), and atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) by
      introducing dental examinations into the annual health examinations conducted by 
      Japanese companies, and to highlights the importance of a medical system that
      connects dental and medical professionals. METHODS: A total of 1.022 Hitachi Ltd.
      employees were enrolled in this cross-sectional study. We examined correlations
      and odds ratios (ORs) between the dental and overall health of employees using
      stratification and multiple logistic regression analyses based on the periodontal
      health indicators, general health indicators, and occlusal force. RESULTS: The
      adjusted OR of PPD for obesity (OR, 1.42; 95% confidence interval [CI],
      1.09-1.84; p = 0.009), IGT (OR, 1.48; 95% CI, 1.00-2.20; p = 0.049), and COPD
      (OR, 1.38; 95% CI, 1.02-1.88; p = 0.038) significantly differed. The adjusted OR 
      of body mass index (OR, 1.28; 95% CI 1.15-1.42; p < 0.001), haemoglobin A1C
      (HbA1c) (OR, 4.34; 95% CI, 1.89-9.98; p < 0.001), fasting blood glucose (FBG)
      levels (OR, 1.08; 95% CI 1.04-1.11; p < 0.001), postbronchodilator forced
      expiratory volume in one second/forced vital capacity ratio (%FEV1) (OR, 0.95;
      95% CI 0.91-1.00; p = 0.031) and smoking (OR, 2.32; 95% CI 1.62-3.33; p < 0.001) 
      for severe periodontal disease also significantly differed. Occlusal force was
      significantly reduced in employees aged 50-59 years compared to those aged 40-49 
      years. Both PPD, HbA1c, FBG levels were significantly associated with occlusal
      force among employees with moderate/severe periodontitis. PPD was significantly
      associated with occlusal force among employees with and moderate COPD, and ASCVD.
      %FEV1 was significantly associated with occlusal force among employees with IGT. 
      CONCLUSIONS: This cross-sectional study revealed mutual relationships among
      periodontal disease, NCDs, and occlusal force on Japanese corporate workers. We
      demonstrated that a comprehensive, regional healthcare system centred on annual
      integrated dental and physical health examinations in the workplace will benefit 
      employees and positively impact corporate health insurance.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has illustrated the importance of infection tracking. The
      role of asymptomatic, undiagnosed individuals in driving infections within this
      pandemic has become increasingly evident. Modern phylogenetic tools that take
      into account asymptomatic or undiagnosed individuals can help guide public health
      responses. We finetuned established phylogenetic pipelines using published
      SARS-CoV-2 genomic data to examine reasonable estimate transmission networks with
      the inference of unsampled infection sources. The system utilised Bayesian
      phylogenetics and TransPhylo to capture the evolutionary and infection dynamics
      of SARS-CoV-2. Our analyses gave insight into the transmissions within a
      population including unsampled sources of infection and the results aligned with 
      epidemiological observations. We were able to observe the effects of preventive
      measures in Canada's "Atlantic bubble" and in populations such as New York State.
      The tools also inferred the cross-species disease transmission of SARS-CoV-2
      transmission from humans to lions and tigers in New York City's Bronx Zoo. These 
      phylogenetic tools offer a powerful approach in response to both the COVID-19 and
      other emerging infectious disease outbreaks.

AB  - The Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) showed
      susceptibility to diverse animal species. We conducted this study to understand
      the spatial epidemiology, genetic diversity, and statistically significant
      genetic similarity along with per-gene recombination events of SARS-CoV-2 and
      related viruses (SC2r-CoVs) in animals globally. We collected a number of
      different animal species infected with SARS-CoV-2 and its related viruses. Then, 
      we retrieved genome sequences of SARS-CoV-2 and SC2r-CoVs from GISAID and NCBI
      GenBank for genomic and mutational analysis. Although the evolutionary origin of 
      SARS-CoV-2 remains elusive, the diverse SC2r-CoV have been detected in multiple
      Rhinolophus bat species and in Malayan pangolin. To date, human-to-animal
      spillover events have been reported in cat, dog, tiger, lion, gorilla, leopard,
      ferret, puma, cougar, otter, and mink in 25 countries. Phylogeny and genetic
      recombination events of SC2r-CoVs showed higher similarity to the bat coronavirus
      RaTG13 and BANAL-103 for most of the genes and to some Malayan pangolin
      coronavirus (CoV) strains for the N protein from bats and pangolin showed close
      resemblance to SARS-CoV-2. The clustering of animal and human strains from the
      same geographical area has proved human-to-animal transmission of the virus. The 
      Alpha, Delta and Mu-variant of SARS-CoV-2 was detected in dog, gorilla, lion,
      tiger, otter, and cat in the USA, India, Czech Republic, Belgium, and France with
      momentous genetic similarity with human SARS-CoV-2 sequences. The mink variant
      mutation (spike_Y453F) was detected in both humans and domestic cats. Moreover,
      the dog was affected mostly by clade O (66.7%), whereas cat and American mink
      were affected by clade GR (31.6 and 49.7%, respectively). The alpha-variant was
      detected as 2.6% in cat, 4.8% in dog, 14.3% in tiger, 66.7% in gorilla, and 77.3%
      in lion. The highest mutations observed in mink where the substitution of D614G
      in spike (95.2%) and P323L in NSP12 (95.2%) protein. In dog, cat, gorilla, lion, 
      and tiger, Y505H and Y453F were the common mutations followed by Y145del,
      Y144del, and V70I in S protein. We recommend vaccine provision for pet and zoo
      animals to reduce the chance of transmission in animals. Besides, continuous
      epidemiological and genomic surveillance of coronaviruses in animal host is
      crucial to find out the immediate ancestor of SARS-CoV-2 and to prevent future
      CoVs threats to humans.

      comorbidities in Pennsylvania, USA.
PG  - 899-906
LID - 10.1002/vms3.695 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
      (SARS-CoV-2), besides causing human infection, has been shown to naturally infect
      several susceptible animal species including large cats (tigers, lions, pumas,
      spotted leopards), dogs, cats, ferrets, gorillas and minks. Cats and minks are
      continuing to be the most reported species with SARS-CoV-2 infections among
      animals but it needs to be investigated further. METHODS AND RESULTS: We report
      the detection of SARS-CoV-2 from a domestic cat that exhibited respiratory
      disease after being exposed to SARS-CoV-2 virus from humans in the same
      household. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was detected in two oropharyngeal swabs collected at
      two time points, 11 days apart; the first, when the cat was reported to be sick
      and the second, before euthanasia due to poor prognosis. The viral nucleic acid
      detected at two time points showed no genomic variation and resembled the clade
      GH circulating in humans in the United States. Clinical and pathological findings
      noted in this 16-year-old cat were consistent with respiratory and cardiac
      insufficiency. CONCLUSIONS: SARS-CoV-2 viral infection was likely an incidental
      clinical finding, as the virus was not detected in fixed lungs, heart, or kidney 
      tissues. Only fresh lung tissue collected at necropsy showed the presence of
      viral nucleic acid, albeit at a very low level. Further research is needed to
      clarify the clinical course of SARS-CoV-2 in companion animals of advanced age
      and underlying cardiac disease.

PG  - 3
LID - 10.1007/s00285-021-01659-2 [doi]
AB  - Aggregation of ubiquitinated cargo by oligomers of the protein p62 is an
      important preparatory step in cellular autophagy. In this work a mathematical
      model for the dynamics of these heterogeneous aggregates in the form of a system 
      of ordinary differential equations is derived and analyzed. Three different
      parameter regimes are identified, where either aggregates are unstable, or their 
      size saturates at a finite value, or their size grows indefinitely as long as
      free particles are abundant. The boundaries of these regimes as well as the
      finite size in the second case can be computed explicitly. The growth in the
      third case (quadratic in time) can also be made explicit by formal asymptotic
      methods. In the absence of rigorous results the dynamic stability of these
      structures has been investigated by numerical simulations. A comparison with
      recent experimental results permits a partial parametrization of the model.

      Dystrophy.
PG  - 11
LID - 10.1167/tvst.10.14.11 [doi]
AB  - Purpose: Rod-cone dystrophy (RCD) is characterized by centripetal loss of rod
      followed by cone photoreceptors. In this prospective, observational cohort, we
      used flood-illumination adaptive optics (AO) imaging to investigate parafoveal
      cone loss in regions with preserved ellipsoid zone (EZ) in patients with RCD.
      Methods: Eight patients with RCD and 10 age-matched healthy controls underwent
      spectral-domain optical coherence tomography and AO imaging. The RCD cohort
      underwent a follow-up examination after 6 months. Cone density (CD) and intercone
      distance (ICD) measurements were performed at 2 degrees temporal from the fovea. 
      Baseline CD and ICD values were compared between the control and patient groups, 
      and longitudinal changes were calculated in the patient group. Residual EZ span
      in patients was measured in horizontal foveal B-scans. Results: Between the
      control and patient groups, there was no significant difference in the baseline
      CD (2094 vs. 1750 cells/deg2, respectively; P = 0.09) and ICD (1.46 vs. 1.62
      arcmin, respectively; P = 0.08). Mean CD declined by 198 cells/deg2 (-11.3%; P < 
      0.01), and mean ICD increased by 0.09 arcmin (+5.6%; P = 0.01) at the 6-month
      follow-up in the patient group. Mean baseline and follow-up residual EZ spans in 
      the six patients with EZ defect were 3189 microm and 3065 microm, respectively
      (-3.9%; P = 0.08). Conclusions: AO imaging detected significant parafoveal cone
      loss over 6-month follow-up even in regions with preserved EZ. Further studies to
      refine AO imaging protocol and validate cone metrics as a structural endpoint in 
      early RCD are warranted. Translational Relevance: CD and ICD may change prior to 
      EZ span shortening in RCD.

AB  - The recent coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak is one of its kind in the
      history of public health that has created a major global threat. The causative
      agent, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has a
      zoonotic source and hence, reverse zoonosis (disease transmission from humans to 
      animals) increases the risk and rate of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Serological and
      molecular analyses and experimental infection studies have identified SARS-CoV-2 
      infection in several animal species in various countries. Different domestic and 
      wild animals, including cats, dogs, tigers, lions, puma, snow leopard, minks, and
      pet ferrets, are infected naturally with SARS-CoV-2, mostly through suspected
      human to animal transmission. In addition, in vivo experimental inoculation
      studies have reported the susceptibility of cats, ferrets, hamsters, Egyptian
      fruit bats, and non-human primates to the virus. These experimentally infected
      species are found to be capable of virus transmission to co-housed animals of the
      same species. However, SARS-CoV-2 showed poor replication in livestock species
      such as pigs, chickens, and ducks with no detection of viral RNA after the
      animals were deliberately inoculated with the virus or exposed to the infected
      animals. As the pets/companion animals are more susceptible to COVID-19, the
      infection in animals needs an in-depth and careful study to avoid any future
      transmissions. The one health approach is the best inter-disciplinary method to
      understand the consequences of viral spread and prevention in novel host
      populations for the betterment of public health. Further in this review, we will 
      explain in detail the different natural and experimentally induced cases of human
      to animal SARS-CoV-2 infection.

AB  - We investigate the effects of seasonal heat stress on cognitive function in
      outdoor workers. Thirty-nine workers from an oil and gas industry in the
      Middle-East volunteered for cognitive testing before (5.30 to 7.00 am) and after 
      (3.30 to 5.00 pm) their daily work-shift in hot (August - average daily
      temperature: ~41 degrees C) and temperate (January - average daily temperature:
      ~22 degrees C) seasons. While physical activity was reduced in hot compared to
      temperate season (average normalized acceleration: 96 +/- 33 vs. 112 +/- 31 x
      10(-3) g; -12.5 +/- 4.7%; P = 0.010), the average core temperature during the
      work-shift was higher in the hot season (37.4 +/- 0.2 vs. 37.2 +/- 0.2 degrees C;
      P = 0.002). Peak core temperature was 38.0 +/- 0.1 degrees C and 37.8 +/- 0.1
      degrees C in hot and temperate seasons, respectively. Cognitive performance did
      not differ between seasons for tests of recognition memory (P = 0.169), working
      memory (P = 0.797) and executive function (P = 0.145), independent of testing
      time. Whereas there was no significant main effect of testing time for tests of
      recognition memory (P = 0.503) and working memory (P = 0.849), the number of
      problems solved on the first choice for the executive function test was lower in 
      the afternoon than the morning (-9.2 +/- 5.3%; P = 0.039). There was no season x 
      testing time interaction for any cognitive tests (P >/= 0.145). In the absence of
      hyperthermia, living and working in a hot environment does not alter cognitive
      function in oil and gas industry workers tested in a quiet and
      temperature-controlled room, with reduced clothing encumbrance (relative to
      work). Conclusions should not be extrapolated to more stressful situations (i.e.,
      thermal stressor present, pronounced dehydration, noise).

PG  - 43
LID - 10.1186/s40317-021-00265-9 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Understanding what animals do in time and space is important for a
      range of ecological questions, however accurate estimates of how animals use
      space is challenging. Within the use of animal-attached tags, radio telemetry
      (including the Global Positioning System, 'GPS') is typically used to verify an
      animal's location periodically. Straight lines are typically drawn between these 
      'Verified Positions' ('VPs') so the interpolation of space-use is limited by the 
      temporal and spatial resolution of the system's measurement. As such, parameters 
      such as route-taken and distance travelled can be poorly represented when using
      VP systems alone. Dead-reckoning has been suggested as a technique to improve the
      accuracy and resolution of reconstructed movement paths, whilst maximising
      battery life of VP systems. This typically involves deriving travel vectors from 
      motion sensor systems and periodically correcting path dimensions for drift with 
      simultaneously deployed VP systems. How often paths should be corrected for
      drift, however, has remained unclear. METHODS AND RESULTS: Here, we review the
      utility of dead-reckoning across four contrasting model species using different
      forms of locomotion (the African lion Panthera leo, the red-tailed tropicbird
      Phaethon rubricauda, the Magellanic penguin Spheniscus magellanicus, and the
      imperial cormorant Leucocarbo atriceps). Simulations were performed to examine
      the extent of dead-reckoning error, relative to VPs, as a function of Verified
      Position correction (VP correction) rate and the effect of this on estimates of
      distance moved. Dead-reckoning error was greatest for animals travelling within
      air and water. We demonstrate how sources of measurement error can arise within
      VP-corrected dead-reckoned tracks and propose advancements to this procedure to
      maximise dead-reckoning accuracy. CONCLUSIONS: We review the utility of
      VP-corrected dead-reckoning according to movement type and consider a range of
      ecological questions that would benefit from dead-reckoning, primarily concerning
      animal-barrier interactions and foraging strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Deficits in global oral health care are paramount, and complications 
      of odontogenic infections constitute a considerable global health problem,
      particularly in low-income countries. A high mortality rate has been observed for
      patients who have been admitted with complicated odontogenic infections to our
      facilities in Tonkolili District, Sierra Leone, although exact data have not been
      published yet. Data regarding who in this region is at risk and why are lacking. 
      OBJECTIVE: The Dental Abscess Study (DELAY) aims to prospectively investigate
      morbidity and mortality from complicated dental abscesses and to analyze
      patients' characteristics and microbial findings to examine predisposing factors 
      for poor outcomes. In particular, the incidence and the clinical and microbial
      characteristics of complicated odontogenic infections, as well as the
      sociodemographic data and comorbidities of affected patients, will be studied to 
      develop improved management algorithms based on circumstance-specific factors.
      METHODS: Patients who present with complicated dental infections requiring
      hospital admission in Masanga Hospital or Lion Heart Medical Centre will be
      consecutively selected for possible inclusion in the study (starting on September
      4, 2021) over a study period of 1 year, and individual routine follow-ups will be
      conducted at least 3 months after discharge. The results of standardized
      questionnaires will be obtained, and clinical measurements as well as medical
      photos will be taken. Standard laboratory tests (eg, full blood count and HIV
      status tests) will be performed, and pus specimens will be examined. Local
      treatment guidelines will be adhered to, and data on medical and surgical
      treatment as well as data on outcomes will be collected. The study results will
      be reported according to the STROBE (Strengthening the Reporting of Observational
      Studies in Epidemiology) criteria. Routine follow-ups will take place at 1 and 3 
      months postdischarge. RESULTS: The DELAY protocol was endorsed by the Masanga
      Medical Research Unit's Scientific Review Committee on June 16, 2021, and ethical
      approval was granted on July 5, 2021, by the Sierra Leone National Ethics
      Committee. The funding of the budgeted study costs was approved by Dental Health 
      International Netherlands in August 2021. The projected start date of data
      collection was September 4, 2021, and the study period will most likely last for 
      1 year. As such, data collection is expected to be complete in November 2022.
      CONCLUSIONS: The aim of our prospective observational cohort study is to gain
      more knowledge about complicated odontogenic infections in Tonkolili District,
      Sierra Leone, to further improve treatment strategies. INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED

TI  - Fine details of the choanocyte filter apparatus in asconoid calcareous sponges
      (Porifera: Calcarea) revealed by ruthenium red fixation.

AB  - Sponges (phylum Porifera) are highly specialized filter-feeding metazoans,
      pumping and filtering water with a network of canals and chambers, the aquiferous
      system. Most sponges have a leuconoid aquiferous system, characterized by
      choanocytes organized in small spherical chambers connected with ambient water by
      a complex net of canals. Such organization requires substantial pressure
      difference to drive water through an elaborate system of canals, so the
      choanocytes in leuconoid sponges have several structural features to generate
      pressure difference. In contrast, it is generally accepted that asconoid and
      syconoid sponges with long choanocyte tubes or large choanocyte chambers have no 
      similar structures in their choanocytes. The present study is devoted to the
      detailed ultrastructural analysis of the choanocytes and their filter apparatus
      in the asconoid calcareous sponge Leucosolenia variabilis. The general structure 
      of L. variabilis choanocytes is similar to that described for other sponge
      species. However, the fixation with 0.1% ruthenium red allowed us to reveal for
      the first time a complex of glycocalyx structures (vanes on the flagella, a fine 
      glycocalyx sealing microvilli in the collar, and a glycocalyx strainer, embedding
      the apical parts of neighboring collars) in the choanocytes of L. variabilis,
      which are traditionally associated with the pumping and filtration process in
      leuconoid demosponges. All revealed glycocalyx structures have dimensions and
      locations similar to those found in the choanocyte chambers of some demosponges. 
      The data suggest that L. variabilis utilizes the principles of water pumping and 
      filtration similar to those in demosponges and revealed glycocalyx structures are
      potentially crucial for these processes. It seems that sponges from distant
      phylogenetic lineages and with different body plans rely on common principles of 
      choanoderm organization for effective pumping and filtration of water. However,
      while some adaptation for effective pumping and filtration of water have possibly
      arisen before the diversification of Porifera, others have appeared independently
      in different lineages.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To demonstrate the technique of laparoscopic implantation of
      neuroprosthesis to the pelvic somatic nerves for recovery of voluntary walking
      motion in some patients with chronic spinal cord injuries. DESIGN: Video.
      SETTING: Tertiary referral unit specialized in advanced gynecologic surgery and
      neuropelveology. INTERVENTIONS: The technique of laparoscopic implantation of
      electrodes on the pelvic nerves-the LION (Laparoscopic Implantation of
      Neuroprothesis) procedure-was introduced by Possover in gynecology more than 15
      years ago for the treatment of refractory pelvic neuropathic pain and bladder
      dysfunctions. From this first indication, further applications were developed,
      especially in the field of parapleology. The "Possover-LION" procedure consists
      of a laparoscopic implantation by transperitoneal approach of 4 stimulation lead 
      electrodes to the sciatic, pudendal, and femoral nerves on both sides in those
      with a spinal cord injury. The femoral nerves are identified laterally to the
      psoas muscles, whereas exposure of the sciatic and pudendal nerves is obtained by
      blunt dissection of the lumbosacral space, laterally to the external iliac
      vessels. The lead electrodes are simply placed in direct contact to the nerves,
      while the retroperitoneal loop of cables prevents from dislocation. Finally, all 
      cables are connected to a multichannel generator implanted in paraumbilical
      position, fixed to the abdominal fascia. CONCLUSION: The LION procedure allows
      the stimulation of the pelvic somatic nerves for recovery of a voluntary
      electrically assisted walking motion in approximately 70% of patients with
      chronic complete or incomplete spinal cord injury.

AB  - SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus causing a globalized outbreak called COVID-19.
      SARS-CoV-2 transmission is associated with inhalation of contaminated respiratory
      droplets and could causes severe complications. Until today several "waves" of
      infections have been observed despite implementation of strict health policies.
      Decisions for such sanitary measures are based on population health monitoring.
      Unfortunately, for COVID-19, a significant proportion of individuals are
      asymptomatic but play a role in the virus transmission. To overcome these
      limitations, several strategies were developed including genome quantification in
      wastewater that could allow monitoring of the health status of population, since 
      shedding of SARS-CoV-2 in patient stool is frequent. Wastewater-based
      epidemiology (WBE) was established and several countries implemented this
      approach to allow COVID-19 outbreak monitoring. In France, the OBEPINE project
      performed a quantitative analysis of SARS-CoV-2 in raw wastewater samples
      collected from major wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) since March 2020. In the 
      greater Paris area 1101 samples (507 for five WWTP and 594 for sewer) were
      collected. This 16 months monitoring allows us to observe the outbreak dynamics. 
      Comparison of WBE indicators with health data lead to several important
      observation; the good level of correlation with incidence rates, the average 3
      days lead time, and the sensitivity (WBE change when incidence is > to 7/100000
      inhabitants). We also compared the local monitoring (city level) with the
      regional monitoring, to help cluster identification. Moreover, variants of
      concern (VOC) emerged due to the selection pressure. We developed a specific
      RT-qPCR method targeting the deletion H69-V70 in the spike protein, using this
      deletion as a proxy of the B.1.1.7 presence in the wastewater. With this data we 
      demonstrate the predominant role played by this strain in the third wave. All
      these results allow a better description and understanding of the pandemic and
      highlight the role of such WBE indicators.

AB  - PURPOSE: To review the current literature on the safety and efficacy of orbital
      radiation for the management of thyroid eye disease (TED). METHODS: A literature 
      search was conducted last in February 2021 of the PubMed database to identify all
      articles published in the English language on original research that assessed the
      effect of orbital radiation on TED. The search identified 55 articles, and 18 met
      the inclusion criteria for this assessment. A panel methodologist then assigned a
      level of evidence rating for each study, and all of them were rated level III.
      RESULTS: Two large retrospective studies demonstrated the efficacy of radiation
      treatment, with or without corticosteroid use, in preventing or treating
      compressive optic neuropathy (CON). Three studies highlighted the role of orbital
      radiation therapy (RT) to facilitate the tapering of corticosteroids. Several
      other studies showed a possible role for RT to improve diplopia and soft tissue
      signs. CONCLUSIONS: Although no level I or level II evidence exists, the best
      available evidence suggests that orbital radiation, used with or without
      corticosteroids, is efficacious in preventing CON, improving motility
      restriction, and decreasing clinical activity in TED. Orbital radiation also may 
      facilitate a corticosteroid taper. Together, these studies show that RT seems to 
      modify the active phase of TED. Short-term risks of orbital radiation are minor, 
      but long-term outcome data are lacking.

AB  - Given the effects of harmful algal blooms (HABs) on human and wildlife health,
      understanding how domoic acid (DA) is accumulated and transferred through food
      webs is critical for recognizing the most affected marine communities and
      predicting ecosystem effects. This study combines stable isotopes of carbon
      (delta(13)C) and nitrogen (delta(15)N) from bulk muscle tissue with DA
      measurements from viscera to identify the foraging strategies of important DA
      vectors and predators in Monterey Bay, CA. Tissue samples were collected from 27 
      species across three habitats in the summer of 2018 and 2019 (time periods
      without prominent HABs). Our results highlight an inshore-offshore variation in
      krill delta(13)C values and DA concentrations ([DA]; ppm) in anchovies indicating
      differences in coastal productivity and DA accumulation. The narrow overlapping
      isotopic niches between anchovies and sardines suggest similar diets and trophic 
      positions, but striking differences in [DA] indicate a degree of specialization, 
      thus, resource partitioning. In contrast, krill, market squid, and juvenile
      rockfish accumulated minimal DA and had comparatively broad isotopic niches,
      suggesting a lower capacity to serve as vectors because of potential differences 
      in diet or feeding in isotopically distinct locations. Low [DA] in the liver of
      stranded sea lions and their generalist foraging tendencies limits our ability to
      use them as sentinels for DA outbreaks in a specific geographic area.
      Collectively, our results show that DA was produced a few kilometers from the
      coastline, and anchovies were the most powerful DA vector in coastal-pelagic
      zones (their DA loads exceeded the 20 ppm FDA regulatory limits for human
      consumption), while mussels did not contain detectable DA and only reflect in
      situ DA, delta(13)C, and delta(15)N values. Our study demonstrates the efficacy
      of combining multiple biogeochemical tracers to improve HAB monitoring efforts
      and identify the main routes of DA transfer across habitats and trophic levels.

TI  - Primary orbital melanoma arising in an atypical diffuse (plaque-like) blue
      naevus/melanocytosis: a case report and review of literature.
PG  - 425
LID - 10.1186/s12886-021-02176-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Primary orbital melanoma is a rare disease and can occasionally
      develop from a pre-existing neoplasm of the blue naevus family of melanocytic
      lesions. CASE PRESENTATION: Herein we report a rare case of primary orbital
      melanoma arising from an unusual atypical diffuse (plaque-like) blue
      naevus/melanocytosis. A 27 year old man presented with mild pain and swelling of 
      the left eye. Magnetic Resonance Imaging revealed a left lateral episcleral
      orbital mass and an incisional biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of malignant
      melanoma. Skin-sparing total left orbital exenteration was performed.
      Histopathological examination of the exenteration specimen revealed a primary
      orbital melanoma arising in a pre-existing blue naevus like melanocytosis. We
      demonstrate the evidence for histological progression, characterise the molecular
      profile of this tumour and discuss the related literature. CONCLUSIONS: This case
      emphasises the importance of a meticulous clinicopathological correlation in
      recognising such a tumour as a primary orbital melanoma rather than a metastasis,
      which is managed differently.

TI  - Global Current Practice Patterns for the Management of Exogenous Endophthalmitis:
      A Survey by the American Society of Ophthalmic Trauma.
PG  - 802-808
LID - 10.1080/02713683.2021.2016857 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To investigate the global practice patterns for the management of
      exogenous endophthalmitis. METHODS: This cross-sectional study was conducted to
      assess global practice patterns for the management of exogenous endophthalmitis. 
      An online survey comprised of questions regarding the management of exogenous
      endophthalmitis was distributed to institutions who are members of International 
      Globe and Adnexal Trauma Epidemiology Study Group (IGATES) or invited affiliates 
      of the American Society of Ophthalmic Trauma and the Asia Pacific Ophthalmic
      Trauma Society. Responses were gathered from August 2020 to January 2021.
      RESULTS: Of 42 institutions, 36 responses were received (86% response rate), of
      which 33 (79%) were included in the analysis. Included centers were from Asia
      (36%), North America (36%), South America (12%), Africa (9%), Europe (3%), and
      Australia (3%). Oral antibiotics were administered in 19 (58%) institutions, with
      moxifloxacin as the preferred agent (n = 9, 27%). The preferred method for
      obtaining cultures was vitreous tap (n = 25, 76%). Most institutions (n = 26,
      79%) routinely administered intravitreal vancomycin and ceftazidime, while
      intravitreal steroids were routinely administered at 11 centers (33%).
      Indications for performing vitrectomy included; decreased visual acuity (n = 14, 
      39%); all cases of exogenous endophthalmitis (n = 4, 12%); non-response to
      medical therapy (n = 4, 12%); or no view of the fundus (n = 4, 12%), indicating
      significant variation in surgical indications. More than half (n = 17, 52%) of
      responding institutions routinely admitted patients with exogenous
      endophthalmitis to the hospital. Institutions in the United States were less
      likely to administer oral antibiotics (27% vs. 73%, P = .024) and to admit
      patients (9% vs. 73%, P < .001) compared to other countries. CONCLUSIONS: This
      study highlights the global variations in the management of exogenous
      endophthalmitis, especially as it pertains to surgical indications. Further
      establishment of evidence-based guidelines may be beneficial to provide more
      uniform guidance to optimize outcomes.

TI  - Analysis of Circulating Tumour Cells in Early-Stage Uveal Melanoma: Evaluation of
      Tumour Marker Expression to Increase Capture.
LID - 5990 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cancers13235990 [doi]
AB  - (1) Background: The stratification of uveal melanoma (UM) patients into
      prognostic groups is critical for patient management and for directing patients
      towards clinical trials. Current classification is based on clinicopathological
      and molecular features of the tumour. Analysis of circulating tumour cells (CTCs)
      has been proposed as a tool to avoid invasive biopsy of the primary tumour.
      However, the clinical utility of such liquid biopsy depends on the detection rate
      of CTCs. (2) Methods: The expression of melanoma, melanocyte, and stem cell
      markers was tested in a primary tissue microarray (TMA) and UM cell lines.
      Markers found to be highly expressed in primary UM were used to either
      immunomagnetically isolate or immunostain UM CTCs prior to treatment of the
      primary lesion. (3) Results: TMA and cell lines had heterogeneous expression of
      common melanoma, melanocyte, and stem cell markers. A multi-marker panel of
      immunomagnetic beads enabled isolation of CTCs in 37/43 (86%) patients with UM.
      Detection of three or more CTCs using the multi-marker panel, but not MCSP alone,
      was a significant predictor of shorter progression free (p = 0.040) and overall
      (p = 0.022) survival. (4) Conclusions: The multi-marker immunomagnetic isolation 
      protocol enabled the detection of CTCs in most primary UM patients. Overall, our 
      results suggest that a multi-marker approach could be a powerful tool for CTC
      separation for non-invasive prognostication of UM.

      Approach to the Tumour Microenvironment.

LID - 10.3390/cancers13235911 [doi]
AB  - Immunotherapy has revolutionised the treatment of cancers by exploiting the
      immune system to eliminate tumour cells. Despite the impressive response in a
      proportion of patients, clinical benefit has been limited thus far. A significant
      focus to date has been the identification of specific markers associated with
      response to immunotherapy. Unfortunately, the heterogeneity between patients and 
      cancer types means identifying markers of response to therapy is inherently
      complex. There is a growing appreciation for the role of the tumour
      microenvironment (TME) in directing response to immunotherapy. The TME is highly 
      heterogeneous and contains immune, stromal, vascular and tumour cells that all
      communicate and interact with one another to form solid tumours. This review
      analyses major cell populations present within the TME with a focus on their
      diverse and often contradictory roles in cancer and how this informs our
      understanding of immunotherapy. Furthermore, we discuss the role of integrated
      omics in providing a comprehensive view of the TME and demonstrate the potential 
      of leveraging multi-omics to decipher the underlying mechanisms of anti-tumour
      immunity for the development of novel immunotherapeutic strategies.

AB  - Meat eating is one of the hallmarks of human evolution. It has been linked to the
      beginning of stone tool use, to physiological changes leading to crucial
      anatomical transformations defining our genus, and to new socioreproductive and
      cognitive behaviors. Uncontroversial evidence of meat eating goes back to 2.6
      million years ago; however, little is known about the frequency and timing with
      which early hominins acquired animal resources. Here, we show that the
      combination of hunting and scavenging documented in some modern human foragers
      may have a long evolutionary trajectory. Using a new set of artificial
      intelligence methods for objective identification, we present direct evidence of 
      an episode of hominins scavenging from large felids-probably lions-discovered at 
      Olduvai Gorge (DS site, Bed I). This casts a new perspective on the diversity of 
      hominin carcass acquisition behaviors and survival strategies, and places some
      early Pleistocene hominins in ecological proximity to African large carnivore
      guilds.

AB  - AIMS: We aimed to estimate the incidence and mortality of uveal melanoma (UM) in 
      Australia from 1982 to 2014. METHODS: Deidentified unit data for all cases of
      ocular melanoma were extracted from the Australian Cancer Database from 1 January
      1982 to 31 December 2014. UM cases were extracted and trends in incidence and
      disease-specific mortality were calculated. Incidence rates were age-standardised
      against the 2001 Australian Standard Population. Mortality was assessed using Cox
      regression. RESULTS: From 1982 to 2014, there were 5087 cases of ocular melanoma 
      in Australia, of which 4617 were classified as UM. The average age-standardised
      incidence rate of UM was 7.6 (95% CI 7.3 to 7.9) per million. There was an
      increase (p=0.0502) in the incidence of UM from 1982 to 1993 with an annual
      percent change (APC) of +2.5%, followed by a significant decrease in the
      incidence of UM from 1993 to 2014 (APC -1.2%). The average 5-year survival from
      1982 to 2011 did not significantly change from an average of 81%, with an average
      APC (AAPC) of +0.1%. A multivariate Cox regression revealed that residence in
      Western Australia (p=0.001) or Tasmania (p=0.05), age >/=60 years (p<0.001) and
      histological classification as mixed (p<0.001) or epithelioid cells (p<0.001)
      were significantly associated with reduced survival. CONCLUSION: In conclusion,
      we found that the incidence of UM peaked in the 1990s. Although treatment for
      primary UM has improved in the last 30 years, overall survival did not change
      significantly in the last 30 years.

TI  - Reduction of Chronic Wasting Disease Prion Seeding Activity following Digestion
      by Mountain Lions.
PG  - e0081221
LID - 10.1128/msphere.00812-21 [doi]
AB  - Chronic wasting disease (CWD) is a transmissible prion disease first observed in 
      the 1960s in North America. This invariably fatal disease affects multiple cervid
      species in the wild and in captivity. In addition to the several known
      transmission pathways involving cervid host species, prions have been detected in
      the feces of crows and coyotes after consumption of experimentally spiked
      tissues. This raises questions about the role of cervid consumers in the
      perpetuation of CWD. Mountain lions have been shown to preferentially select
      CWD-infected prey and are also apparently resistant to infection. In this study, 
      two captive mountain lions were fed ground mule deer muscle tissue spiked with
      brain-derived CWD prions, and lion feces were collected for 1 week afterward. The
      input brain and resulting fecal materials were analyzed using the highly
      sensitive real-time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC) assay to quantify prion 
      seeding activity. We recovered only 2.8 to 3.9% of input CWD prions after passage
      through the mountain lions' gastrointestinal tracts. Interestingly, CWD prions
      were shed only in the first defecation following consumption. Our data support
      the possibility that mountain lions feeding upon infected carcasses could excrete
      CWD prions in their feces over a short period of time but also suggest that most 
      of the ingested prions are eliminated or sequestered by this large predator.
      IMPORTANCE CWD prions appear to spread naturally among susceptible cervid species
      in captivity and in the wild. A better understanding of all the ways these prions
      move, persist, and subsequently infect target species through the environment is 
      critical to developing comprehensive disease control strategies. In our study, we
      show limited, transient pass-through of CWD prions in an apex predator, the
      mountain lion, using the highly sensitive RT-QuIC assay on feces collected after 
      lions were fed prion-spiked muscle tissue. Prions were detected in feces only in 
      the first defecation after exposure. Moreover, the amount of CWD prions recovered
      in feces was reduced by >96% after passing through the lion digestive system.
      This indicates that mountain lions may have some potential to distribute CWD
      prions within their home ranges but that they also effectively eliminate most of 
      the CWD prions they consume.

AB  - The Australian sea lion (Neophoca cinerea) is an endangered and declining otariid
      species, with a high rate of pup mortality associated with endemic hookworm
      (Uncinaria sanguinis) infection a suspected contributor to this decline. Injected
      ivermectin is an effective treatment for Uncinaria sp. in otariids, with optimal 
      outcomes achieved by the early treatment of pups prior to disease development.
      This randomised controlled trial evaluated the effectiveness of the novel use of 
      a topical ivermectin formulation against hookworm infection and lice
      (Antarctophthirus microchir) infestation, in comparison with injected ivermectin.
      During the 2017 breeding season at Dangerous Reef, South Australia, pups </= 70
      cm in standard length (</= 2 weeks of age; n = 85) were randomised to single dose
      topical (500 mug/kg spot-on; n = 27) or injected (200 mug/kg subcutaneous; n =
      29) ivermectin treatment groups, or to an untreated control group (n = 29).
      Topical ivermectin was highly effective for U. sanguinis elimination, and not
      significantly different to the injected formulation (estimated effectiveness
      96.4% and 96.8%, respectively; P > 0.05). Its application resulted in an 81.6%
      reduction and 62.7% additional clearance for A. microchir infestation by 15-24
      days post-treatment, compared with untreated control pups (also not significantly
      different to injected ivermectin; 83.1% and 59.4%, respectively; P > 0.05).
      Treatment with either ivermectin formulation significantly ameliorated increases 
      in inflammatory markers detected in the blood of untreated control pups -
      peripheral blood eosinophil counts (persisting to 36-41 days post-recruitment P <
      0.05) and increased plasma protein concentrations (15-24 days post-recruitment; P
      < 0.05). Further, an initial short-term decrease in body condition in the control
      group was not observed in either of the treatment groups. This study demonstrates
      that topical ivermectin is an effective antiparasitic treatment in N. cinerea. It
      offers an alternative administration method for ivermectin delivery to a young
      pup cohort in this species, and an alternative, minimally invasive management
      tool for species conservation.

TI  - Ultrasonic instruments in orbital surgery: a major review.
PG  - 287-291
LID - 10.1080/01676830.2021.2005635 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Ultrasonic instrumentation has recently emerged as an important modality
      in orbital surgery. This review was designed to assess the current literature and
      potential advantages of this technology. METHODS: A PubMed search was performed
      to identify relevant articles. These manuscripts were reviewed, and their data
      was abstracted. RESULTS: Three variants of ultrasonic devices are gaining
      popularity in orbital surgery, including piezoelectric saws, the cavitron system,
      and ultrasonic bone aspirators and curettes. Previous manuscripts have described 
      a variety of uses for these technologies, and the purported benefits include
      enhanced intraoperative visualization, improved facility in tight spaces, less
      damage to the surrounding parenchyma and vasculature, and excellent
      intraoperative dissection. CONCLUSIONS: The emerging body of literature strongly 
      supports the use of these devices in orbital surgery, and these instruments carry
      the promise of providing smoother, more precise, safer surgery.

TI  - The within- and between-laboratories reproducibility and predictive capacity of
      Amino acid Derivative Reactivity Assay using 4 mM test chemical solution: Results
      of ring study implemented at five participating laboratories.
PG  - 318-333
LID - 10.1002/jat.4268 [doi]
AB  - Amino acid derivative reactivity assay (ADRA) for skin sensitization was adopted 
      as an alternative method in the 2019 OECD Guideline for the Testing of Chemicals 
      (OECD TG 442C). The molar ratio of the nucleophilic reagent to the test chemicals
      in the reaction solution was set to 1:50. Imamura et al. reported that changing
      this molar ratio from 1:50 to 1:200 reduced in false negatives and improved
      prediction accuracy. Hence, a ring study using ADRA with 4 mM of a test chemical 
      solution (ADRA, 4 mM) was conducted at five different laboratories to verify
      within- and between-laboratory reproducibilities (WLR and BLR, respectively). In 
      this study, we investigated the WLR and BLR using 14 test chemicals grouped into 
      three classes: (1) eight proficiency substances, (2) four test chemicals that
      showed false negatives in the ADRA with 1 mM test chemical solution (ADRA, 1 mM),
      but correctly positive in ADRA (4 mM), and (3) current positive control
      (phenylacetaldehyde) and a new additional positive control (squaric acid diethyl 
      ester). The results showed 100% reproducibility and 100% accuracy for skin
      sensitization. Hence, it is clear that the ADRA (4 mM) is an excellent test
      method in contrast to the currently used ADRA (1 mM). We plan to resubmit the
      ADRA (4 mM) test method to the OECD Test Guideline Group in the near future so
      that OECD TG 442C could be revised for the convenience and benefit of many ADRA
      users.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Investigating brain dynamics underlying vocal production in animals
      is a powerful way to inform on the neural bases of human speech. In particular,
      brain networks underlying vocal production in non-human primates show striking
      similarities with the human speech production network. However, despite
      increasing findings also in birds and more recently in rodents, the extent to
      which the primate vocal cortical network model generalizes to other non-primate
      mammals remains unclear. Especially, no domestic species has yet been proposed to
      investigate vocal brain activity using electrophysiological approaches. NEW
      METHOD: In the present study, we introduce a novel experimental paradigm to
      identify the cortical dynamics underlying vocal production in behaving minipigs. 
      A key problem to chronically implant cortical probes in pigs is the presence and 
      growth of frontal sinuses extending caudally to the parietal bone and preventing 
      safe access to neural structures with conventional craniotomy in adult animals.
      RESULTS: Here we first show that implantations of soft ECoG grids can be done
      safely using conventional craniotomy in minipigs younger than 5 months, a period 
      when sinuses are not yet well developed. Using wireless recordings in behaving
      animals, we further show activation of the motor and premotor cortex around the
      onset of vocal production of grunts, the most common vocalization of pigs.
      CONCLUSION: These results suggest that minipigs, which are very loquacious and
      social animals, can be a good experimental large animal model to study the
      cortical bases of vocal production.

TI  - Immunotherapy of HBV-related advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with short-term
      HBV-specific TCR expressed T cells: results of dose escalation, phase I trial.
PG  - 1402-1412
LID - 10.1007/s12072-021-10250-2 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND & AIMS: Immunotherapy with hepatitis B virus (HBV)-specific TCR
      redirected T (HBV-TCR-T) cells in HBV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HBV-HCC) 
      patients after liver transplantation was reported to be safe and had potential
      therapeutic efficacy. We aim to investigate the safety of HBV-TCR-T-cell
      immunotherapy in advanced HBV-HCC patients who had not met the criteria for liver
      transplantation. METHODS: We enrolled eight patients with advanced HBV-HCC and
      adoptively transferred short-lived autologous T cells expressing HBV-specific TCR
      to perform an open-label, phase 1 dose-escalation study (NCT03899415). The
      primary endpoint was to evaluate the safety of HBV-TCR-T-cell therapy according
      to National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events
      (version 4.03) during the dose-escalation process. The secondary endpoint was to 
      assess the efficacy of HBV-TCR-T-cell therapy by evaluating the anti-tumor
      responses using RECIST criteria (version 1.1) and the overall survival. RESULTS: 
      Adverse events were observed in two participants among the 8 patients enrolled.
      Only one patient experienced a Grade 3 liver-related adverse event after
      receiving a dose of 1 x 10(5) HBV-TCR-T cells/kg, then normalized without
      interventions with immunosuppressive agents. Among the patients, one achieved a
      partial response lasting for 27.7 months. Importantly, most of the patients
      exhibited a reduction or stabilization of circulating HBsAg and HBV DNA levels
      after HBV-TCR-T-cell infusion, indicating the on-target effects. CONCLUSIONS: The
      adoptive transfer of HBV-TCR-T cells into advanced HBV-HCC patients were
      generally safe and well-tolerated. Observations of clinical efficacy support the 
      continued development and eventual application of this treatment strategy in
      patients with advanced HBV-related HCC. CLINICAL TRIALS REGISTRATION: This study 
      was registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT03899415).

AB  - One approach to understand people's efforts to reduce disease transmission, is to
      consider the effect of behaviour on case rates. In this paper we present a
      spatial infection-reducing game model of public behaviour, formally equivalent to
      a Hopfield neural network coupled to SIRS disease dynamics. Behavioural game
      parameters can be precisely calibrated to geographical time series of Covid-19
      active case numbers, giving an implied spatial history of behaviour. This is used
      to investigate the effects of government intervention, quantify behaviour area by
      area, and measure the effect of wealth on behaviour. We also demonstrate how a
      delay in people's perception of risk levels can induce behavioural instability,
      and oscillations in infection rates.

TI  - Agreement of anterior segment measurements between four diagnostic imaging
      devices in myopic patients.
PG  - 1235-1243
LID - 10.1080/17434440.2021.2012153 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To compare the inter-device agreement of anterior chamber depth (ACD),
      central corneal thickness (CCT), flat keratometry (K1), steep keratometry (K2),
      corneal astigmatism (DeltaK), and white-to-white (WTW) measurements. METHODS:
      This is a retrospective study with 73 myopic patients (142 eyes). We extracted
      and compared anterior segment measurements (ACD, CCT, K1, K2, DeltaK, and WTW) of
      four devices (OPD-Scan III, Pentacam HR, Lenstar LS 900, and Galilei G4), and
      performed pairwise agreement comparisons between them. RESULTS: Agreement
      analyses revealed that the most agreement occurred: in Pentacam HR and Galilei G4
      for ACD measurements, in Pentacam HR and Lenstar LS 900 for CCT measurements, in 
      OPD-Scan III and Galilei G4 for WTW measurements, in OPD-Scan III and Pentacam HR
      for K1 and K2 measurements, and OPD-Scan III and Galilei G4 for DeltaK
      measurements. CONCLUSION: OPD-Scan III is interchangeable with both Galilei G4
      and Lenstar LS 900 for WTW measurements. OPD-Scan III and the Pentacam-HR are
      interchangeable in K1, K2, and DeltaK measurements. OPD-Scan III and Lenstar LS
      900, and OPD-Scan III and Galilei G4 are interchangeable in K1 and DeltaK
      measurements, respectively.

TI  - Comparison of Donor Corneal Endothelial Cell Density Determined by Eye Banks and 
      by a Central Image Analysis Reading Center Using the Same Image Analysis Method.
PG  - 664-668
LID - 10.1097/ICO.0000000000002935 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The purpose of this study was to evaluate agreement between eye banks
      (EBs) and an image analysis reading center on endothelial cell density (ECD)
      determinations using the same image analysis method. METHODS: The Cornea Image
      Analysis Reading Center (CIARC) determined ECD with a single experienced analyst 
      on EB-obtained central endothelial images from donors intended for keratoplasty
      from 2 eye banks, Eversight and Lions VisionGift, using the Konan center analysis
      method. The EBs performed ECD determination on their respective sets of images
      using the same analysis method with experienced eye bank technicians. RESULTS:
      The mean age of the 200 donors was 54 years (range 30-75 years). Seventy (35%) of
      the 200 patients were women, and 57 (29%) were diabetic. The mean ECD was 10
      cells/mm2 greater by the EBs than by CIARC (P = 0.39), with 95% limits of
      agreement of [-304 to 323 cells/mm2]. The mean difference was not substantially
      changed when the difference between EBs and CIARC ECD was adjusted for sex, donor
      age, donor diabetes, CV, HEX, number of cells analyzed, and EBs as a random
      effect (estimated mean difference of 20 cells/mm2 after adjustment in a linear
      mixed model; P = 0.73). The EB-determined preoperative ECD was within 10% of the 
      CIARC-determined ECD for 178 (89%) image sets, with 15 (8%) higher by >10% and 7 
      (3%) lower by >10%. CONCLUSIONS: Well-trained eye bank technicians achieve
      comparable results for ECD determination with an experienced image analyst from
      an image analysis reading center when the same image analysis method is used.

TI  - "It feels like sending your children into the lions' den" - A qualitative
      investigation into parental attitudes towards ASD inclusion, and the impact of
      mainstream education on their child.

LID - S0891-4222(21)00277-8 [pii]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing numbers of autistic children are being educated in
      mainstream schools. The success of inclusive education is dependent upon multiple
      factors, including key stakeholders (i.e., teachers and parents). Research has
      tended to focus on teachers' experiences of inclusion with limited focus on
      parents. AIMS: The study aimed to qualitatively investigate parental attitudes
      and experiences of inclusive education. As such, the research question was: What 
      are attitudes towards, and experiences of, inclusive education for parents of
      autistic children? METHODS AND PROCEDURE: Semi-structured interviews were
      conducted with 12 parents of autistic children. Data was analysed using Thematic 
      Analysis (Braun & Clarke, 2006). OUTCOMES AND RESULTS: four themes were
      identified; 1) Feeling Unheard; 2) Implementation of Inclusive Strategies; 3)
      Social Exclusion; 4) Mental Health and Wellbeing Impact. Findings suggested that 
      parents felt their child struggled socially in mainstream school, with such
      experiences negatively impacting upon their child's wellbeing. The detrimental
      impacts were a result of parents believing school staff dismissed their concerns 
      and thus appropriate strategies for their child were not always implemented.
      CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS: This highlights the need for school staff and
      parents to work together to enhance inclusivity both academically and socially
      for autistic children.

TI  - Metabolism in Retinopathy of Prematurity.
LID - 1119 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/life11111119 [doi]
AB  - Retinopathy of prematurity is defined as retinal abnormalities that occur during 
      development as a consequence of disturbed oxygen conditions and nutrient supply
      after preterm birth. Both neuronal maturation and retinal vascularization are
      impaired, leading to the compensatory but uncontrolled retinal neovessel growth. 
      Current therapeutic interventions target the hypoxia-induced neovessels but
      negatively impact retinal neurons and normal vessels. Emerging evidence suggests 
      that metabolic disturbance is a significant and underexplored risk factor in the 
      disease pathogenesis. Hyperglycemia and dyslipidemia correlate with the retinal
      neurovascular dysfunction in infants born prematurely. Nutritional and hormonal
      supplementation relieve metabolic stress and improve retinal maturation. Here we 
      focus on the mechanisms through which metabolism is involved in
      preterm-birth-related retinal disorder from clinical and experimental
      investigations. We will review and discuss potential therapeutic targets through 
      the restoration of metabolic responses to prevent disease development and
      progression.

TI  - Dynamic Landscape of Extracellular Vesicle-Associated Proteins Is Related to
      Treatment Response of Patients with Metastatic Breast Cancer.
LID - 880 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/membranes11110880 [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in women. The majority of
      these deaths are due to disease metastasis, in which cancer cells disseminate to 
      multiple organs and disrupt vital physiological functions. It is widely accepted 
      that breast cancer cells secrete extracellular vesicles (EVs), which contain
      dynamic molecular cargo that act as versatile mediators of intercellular
      communication. Therefore, Evs. secreted by breast cancer cells could be involved 
      in the development of metastatic disease and resistance to treatment. Moreover,
      changes in EV cargo could reflect the effects of therapy on their parent tumor
      cells. The aim of this feasibility study was to quantitatively profile the
      proteomes of Evs. isolated from blood samples taken from treatment sensitive and 
      resistant metastatic breast cancer patients to identify proteins associated with 
      responses. Three serial blood samples were collected from three patients with
      metastatic breast cancer receiving systemic therapy including a responder, a
      non-responder, and a mixed-responder. Evs. were isolated from plasma using size
      exclusion chromatography and their protein cargo was prepared for tandem mass tag
      (TMT)-labelling and quantitative analyses using two-dimensional high-performance 
      liquid chromatography followed by tandem mass spectrometry. After filtering, we
      quantitatively identified 286 proteins with high confidence using a q value of
      0.05. Of these, 149 were classified as EV associated candidate proteins and 137
      as classical, high abundant plasma proteins. After comparing EV protein abundance
      between the responder and non-responder, we identified 35 proteins with unique
      de-regulated abundance patterns that was conserved at multiple time points. We
      propose that this proof-of-concept approach can be used to identify proteins
      which have potential as predictors of metastatic breast cancer response to
      treatment.

AB  - Soluble PD-L1 (sPD-L1) levels have been identified as a potential biomarker for
      various cancers, but its diagnostic and prognostic value in urinary bladder
      cancer (BC) remains to be fully elucidated. In this study, we investigated sPD-L1
      levels in serum and urine samples from 132 patients with BC and compared them to 
      51 patients with hematuria (controls). The levels of sPD-L1 in serum and urine
      were determined using ELISA. Soluble PD-L1 could be detected in 99.5% of the
      serum samples and 34.4% of the urine samples. Patients diagnosed with BC had
      significantly higher urinary levels of sPD-L1, compared to controls, however no
      difference were found in serum sPD-L1 levels (p = 0.038 and p = 0.61,
      respectively). Significantly higher serum sPD-L1 levels were found in patients
      with muscle invasive disease and metastatic disease, compared to patients with
      non-muscle invasive BC and non-metastatic disease (p < 0.05). There was also a
      trend for higher urine sPD-L1 levels in patients with metastatic disease,
      compared to patients with non-metastatic disease (p = 0.05). The results from
      this study suggest that sPD-L1 in serum, but not in urine, could be a potential
      prognostic biomarker for patients with BC.

      Resistance in Pediatric High-Grade Gliomas.
LID - 5678 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cancers13225678 [doi]
AB  - Despite their low incidence, pediatric high-grade gliomas (pHGGs), including
      diffuse intrinsic pontine gliomas (DIPGs), are the leading cause of mortality in 
      pediatric neuro-oncology. Recurrent, mutually exclusive mutations affecting K27
      (K27M) and G34 (G34R/V) in the N-terminal tail of histones H3.3 and H3.1 act as
      key biological drivers of pHGGs. Notably, mutations in H3.3 are frequently
      associated with mutations affecting ATRX and DAXX, which encode a chaperone
      complex that deposits H3.3 into heterochromatic regions, including telomeres. The
      K27M and G34R/V mutations lead to distinct epigenetic reprogramming, telomere
      maintenance mechanisms, and oncogenesis scenarios, resulting in distinct
      subgroups of patients characterized by differences in tumor localization,
      clinical outcome, as well as concurrent epigenetic and genetic alterations.
      Contrasting with our understanding of the molecular biology of pHGGs, there has
      been little improvement in the treatment of pHGGs, with the current mainstays of 
      therapy-genotoxic chemotherapy and ionizing radiation (IR)-facing the development
      of tumor resistance driven by complex DNA repair pathways. Chromatin and
      nucleosome dynamics constitute important modulators of the DNA damage response
      (DDR). Here, we summarize the major DNA repair pathways that contribute to
      resistance to current DNA damaging agent-based therapeutic strategies and
      describe the telomere maintenance mechanisms encountered in pHGGs. We then review
      the functions of H3.3 and its chaperones in chromatin dynamics and DNA repair, as
      well as examining the impact of their mutation/alteration on these processes.
      Finally, we discuss potential strategies targeting DNA repair and epigenetic
      mechanisms as well as telomere maintenance mechanisms, to improve the treatment
      of pHGGs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is associated with Dementia, and it is also 
      a memory syndrome in the brain. It affects the brain tissues and causes major
      changes in day-to-day activities. Aging is a major cause of Alzheimer's disease. 
      AD is characterized by two pathological hallmarks as, Amyloid beta protein and
      neurofibrillary tangles of hyperphosphorylated tau protein. The imaging hallmarks
      for Alzheimer's disease are namely, swelling, shrinkage of brain tissues due to
      cell loss, and atrophy in the brain due to protein dissemination. Based on the
      survey, 60% to 80% of dementia patients belong to Alzheimer's disease.
      INTRODUCTION: AD is now becoming an increasing and important brain disease. The
      goal of AD pathology is to cause changes/damage in brain tissues. Alzheimer's
      disease is thought to begin 20 years or more before symptoms appear, with tiny
      changes in the brain that are undetectable to the person affected. The changes in
      a person's brain after a few years are noticeable through symptoms such as
      language difficulties and memory loss. Neurons in different parts of the brain
      have detected symptoms such as cognitive impairments and learning disabilities.
      In this case, neuroimaging tools are necessary to identify the development of
      pathology which relates to the clinical symptoms. METHODS: Several approaches
      have been tried during the last two decades for brain screening to analyse AD
      with the process of pre-processing, segmentation and classification. Different
      individual such as Grey Wolf optimization, Lion Optimization, Ant Lion
      Optimization and so on. Similarly, hybrid optimization techniques are also
      attempted to segment the brain sub-regions which helps in identifying the
      bio-markers to analyse AD. CONCLUSION: This study discusses a review of
      neuroimaging technologies for diagnosing Alzheimer's disease, as well as the
      discovery of hallmarks for the disease and the methodologies for finding
      hallmarks from brain images to evaluate AD. According to the literature review,
      most of the techniques predicted higher accuracy (more than 90%), which is
      beneficial for assessing and screening neurodegenerative illness, particularly
      Alzheimer's disease.

TI  - Adenosine receptor ligation tips the uveitogenic Th1 and Th17 balance towards the
      latter in experimental autoimmune uveitis-induced mouse.
PG  - 93-103
LID - 10.1016/j.crimmu.2021.07.001 [doi]
AB  - Various pathological conditions are accompanied by release of adenosine
      triphosphate (ATP) from the intracellular to the extracellular compartment, where
      it degrades into adenosine and modulates immune responses. Previous studies
      concluded that both ATP and its degradation product adenosine are important
      immune-regulatory molecules; ATP acted as a danger signal that promotes immune
      responses, but adenosine's effect was inhibitory. We show that adenosine receptor
      ligation plays an important role in balancing Th1 and Th17 pathogenic T cell
      responses in experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU). While its effect on Th1
      responses is inhibitory, its effect on Th17 responses is enhancing, thereby
      impacting the balance between Th1 and Th17 responses. Mechanistic studies showed 
      that this effect is mediated via several immune cells, among which gammadelta T
      cell activation and dendritic cell differentiation are prominent; adenosine- and 
      gammadelta-mediated immunoregulation synergistically impact each other's effect. 
      Adenosine receptor ligation augments the activation of gammadelta T cells, which 
      is an important promoter for Th17 responses and has a strong effect on dendritic 
      cell (DC) differentiation, tipping the balance from generation of DCs that
      stimulate Th1 responses to those that stimulate Th17 responses. The knowledge
      acquired in this study should improve our understanding of the immune-regulatory 
      effect of extracellular ATP-adenosine metabolism and improve treatment for
      autoimmune diseases caused by both Th1-and Th17-type pathogenic T cells.

TI  - Lateral Flank Approach for Ovariohysterectomy in a Lion (Panthera leo) with a
      Ruptured Pyometra.
LID - 245 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vetsci8110245 [doi]
AB  - An 8.5-year-old intact female lion (Panthera leo) with a history of vomiting,
      lethargy, and anorexia was referred to our institution. On physical examination, 
      the lion weighed 180 kg and had a rectal temperature of 40 degrees C. Blood
      analysis showed mild neutrophilic leukocytosis, and abdominal ultrasonography
      revealed an enlarged uterus with echogenic fluid. Based on the clinical signs and
      hematologic and ultrasonographic findings, the lion was tentatively diagnosed
      with pyometra. Ovariohysterectomy was performed using the lateral flank approach 
      to avoid complications that can occur with ventral celiotomy. Surgery was
      performed successfully despite unexpected rupture of the uterus which had
      occurred before the surgery. The lion recovered uneventfully and continued to do 
      well at the 1 year follow up after surgery. To the best of our knowledge, this is
      the first reported case of ovariohysterectomy with the lateral flank approach in 
      a lion with pyometra. Our report suggests that ovariohysterectomy with the
      lateral flank approach could be considered as an alternative method for pyometra 
      in wild big cats with risk of complications at the surgical site.

TI  - Conjunctival ultraviolet autofluorescence area decreases with age and sunglasses 
      use.
LID - bjophthalmol-2021-320284 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/bjophthalmol-2021-320284 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Conjunctival ultraviolet autofluorescence (CUVAF) is a method of
      detecting conjunctival damage related to ultraviolet radiation exposure. In
      cross-sectional studies, CUVAF area is positively associated with self-reported
      time spent outdoors and pterygium and negatively associated with myopia; however,
      longitudinal studies are scarce. AIMS: To use a novel deep learning-based tool to
      assess 8-year change in CUVAF area in young adults, investigate factors
      associated with this change and identify the number of new onset pterygia.
      METHODS: A deep learning-based CUVAF tool was developed to measure CUVAF area.
      CUVAF area and pterygium status were assessed at three study visits: baseline
      (participants were approximately 20 years old) and at 7-year and 8-year
      follow-ups. Participants self-reported sun protection behaviours and ocular
      history. RESULTS: CUVAF data were available for 1497 participants from at least
      one study visit; 633 (43%) participants had complete CUVAF data. Mean CUVAF areas
      at baseline and the 7-year and 8-year follow-ups were 48.4, 39.3 and 37.7 mm(2), 
      respectively. There was a decrease in mean CUVAF area over time (change in total 
      CUVAF area=-0.96 mm(2) per year (95% CI: -1.07 to -0.86)). For participants who
      wore sunglasses >/=1/2 of the time, CUVAF area decreased by an additional -0.42
      mm(2) per year (95% CI: -0.72 to -0.12) on average. Fourteen (1.5%) participants 
      developed a pterygium. CONCLUSIONS: In this young adult cohort, CUVAF area
      declined over an 8-year period. Wearing sunglasses was associated with a faster
      reduction in CUVAF area. Deep learning-based models can assist in accurate and
      efficient measurement of CUVAF area.

AB  - Prevalence data on severe dental infections is scarce, particularly for
      low-income countries. Patients with dental abscess complications who presented
      from September 2020 until December 2020 in two hospitals in Tonkolili District,
      Sierra Leone, were included into this case series. We report on a total of 20
      patients, median age 28 years, with severe complications of dental abscesses,
      with a mortality rate of 45%. This case series illustrates the severity of the
      dire consequences of the absence of access to basic dental and oral healthcare.

TI  - Design of a prospective, longitudinal cohort of people living with type 1
      diabetes exploring factors associated with the residual cardiovascular risk and
      other diabetes-related complications: The SFDT1 study.

AB  - Type 1 diabetes mellitus (T1DM) is associated with a high risk of cardiovascular 
      (CV) complications, even after controlling for traditional CV risk factors.
      Therefore, determinants of the residual increased CV morbidity and mortality
      remain to be discovered. This prospective cohort of people living with T1DM in
      France (SFDT1) will include adults and children aged over six years living with
      T1DM, recruited throughout metropolitan France and overseas French departments
      and territories. The primary objective is to better understand the parameters
      associated with CV complications in T1DM. Clinical data and biobank samples will 
      be collected during routine visits every three years. Data from connected tools, 
      including continuous glucose monitoring, will be available during the 10-year
      active follow-up. Patient-reported outcomes, psychological and socioeconomic
      information will also be collected either at visits or through web questionnaires
      accessible via the internet. Additionally, access to the national health data
      system (Health Data Hub) will provide information on healthcare and a passive
      20-year medico-administrative follow-up. Using Health Data Hub, SFDT1
      participants will be compared to non-diabetic individuals matched on age, gender,
      and residency area. The cohort is sponsored by the French-speaking Foundation for
      Diabetes Research (FFRD) and aims to include 15,000 participants.

PG  - 1055-1067

AB  - Ophthalmic trauma is a leading cause of preventable monocular blindness
      worldwide. The prevalence of ophthalmic trauma varies considerably based on
      geographic location, socio-economic status, age groups, occupation, and cultural 
      practices such as firework celebrations. Clinical registries are known to be
      valuable in guiding the diagnosis, management, and prognostication of complex
      diseases. However, there is currently a lack of a centralized international data 
      repository for ophthalmic trauma. We draw lessons from past and existing clinical
      registries related to ophthalmology and propose a new suitable international
      multicenter clinical registry for ophthalmic trauma: the International Globe and 
      Adnexal Trauma Epidemiology Study (IGATES). IGATES is hosted on a secure
      web-based platform which exhibits user-friendly smart features, an integrated
      Ocular Trauma Score (OTS) prognosis calculator, efficient data collection points,
      and schematic graphical software. IGATES currently has 37 participating centers
      globally. The data collected through IGATES will be primarily used to develop a
      more robust and improved ophthalmic trauma prognostic classification system, the 
      Ocular Trauma Score-2 (OTS-2), which builds on previous systems such as the
      Birmingham Eye Trauma Terminology System (BETTS) and Ocular Trauma Score (OTS).
      Furthermore, IGATES will act as a springboard for further research into the
      epidemiology, diagnosis, and management of ophthalmic trauma. Ultimately, IGATES 
      serves to advance the field of ophthalmic trauma and improve the care that
      patients with ophthalmic trauma receive.

TI  - Analysis of 23 Years of Cornea Donor Data From an Eye Bank in Turkey.
PG  - 1191-1196
LID - 10.6002/ect.2021.0072 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We evaluated 23 years of data for cornea donors at the Istanbul
      Faculty of Medicine Lions Eye Bank. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Annual statistics of
      corneal donors between 1996 and 2019 were reviewed retrospectively. Records for
      2008 and previous years were compared with records for 2009 and years
      thereafter,to assess donor demographics and reasons for discard of corneas.
      RESULTS: A total of 3849 corneas were obtained from 2018 donors during a 23-year 
      period. Of these, 26 donors (11.2%) were registered, whereas 1792 (88.8%) did not
      register any decision for donation. There were 210 (5.46%) corneas discarded for 
      positive serology and 291 (7.56%) for unsuitable tissue morphology, and 3348
      (86.98%) corneas were determined to be suitable for transplant. For the cause of 
      death in 2009 and subsequent years, the incidence of trauma was lower (P = .001) 
      compared with the years previous to 2009, whereas incidence of cardiac pathology 
      (P = .014) was higher. The number of donors older than 50 years was higher for
      2009 and years thereafter, compared with data from earlier years (P = .024). The 
      rate of discarded corneas for unsuitable tissue morphology (P = .004) and total
      discarded corneas (P = .027) decreased in 2009 and years thereafter. The rate of 
      discarded corneas for HIV was higher after for 2009 and years thereafter (P =
      .047), whereas the rate of discarded corneas for syphilis was significantly
      higher for 2015 and years thereafter (P = .001). CONCLUSIONS: This study
      evaluated the most extensive eye bank data in Turkey and found that advances in
      lamellar surgery techniques and improvements in specular microscopic facilities
      have expanded the pool for cornealtransplants to include tissues from older
      donors. Moreover, the incidence rates for HIVpositive and syphilis-positive
      serology tests in discarded corneas have increased over time.

TI  - A molecular and morphological study of Otocryptis Wagler, 1830 (Squamata:
      Agamidae) reveals a new genus from the far south of the Western Ghats, Peninsular
      India.
PG  - 205-228
LID - 10.11646/zootaxa.5016.2.3 [doi]
AB  - In recent years, several studies have revealed significant unknown and cryptic
      diversity of agamids in peninsular India, particularly in the Western Ghats.
      Here, we examine the morphology, anatomy and genetics of the sole Indian
      representative of the otherwise Sri Lankan agamid genus Otocryptis from the
      Western Ghats. Our analyses reveal significant distinctions in O. beddomii
      Boulenger, 1885 with respect to the Sri Lankan members, the type species, O.
      wiegmanni Wagler, 1830, and O. nigristigma Bahir de Silva, 2005, warranting a new
      generic placement. To accommodate the divergent and allopatric O. beddomii from
      the Western Ghats, we erect a new genus Agasthyagama gen. nov. We re-characterise
      Agasthyagama beddomii (Boulenger, 1885) comb. nov. based on a syntype (ZSI 15733)
      and recently collected material. In effect, we restrict the genus Otocryptis,
      represented by two species, O. wiegmanni and O. nigristigma, to Sri Lanka. We
      also provide a re-appraisal of the genus Otocryptis sensu stricto, based on data 
      from its type species O. wiegmanni. Our finding adds another endemic agamid genus
      to the Western Ghats, following Salea Gray, 1845, and the recently described
      Monilesaurus Pal, Vijayakumar, Shanker, Jayarajan Deepak, 2018, and Microauris
      Pal, Vijayakumar, Shanker, Jayarajan Deepak, 2018. In turn, this complements Sri 
      Lankan agamid endemism with Otocryptis, in addition to the accepted endemic
      radiations of Lyriocephalus Merrem, 1820, Ceratophora Gray, 1835 and Cophotis
      Peters, 1861. From a systematic perspective, our erection of Agasthyagama gen.
      nov. likely completes the description of known genus-level diversity in the clade
      containing Otocryptis Wagler 1830, Sitana Cuvier, 1829 and the recently described
      Sarada Deepak, Karanth Giri, 2016.

TI  - Ducks lay eggs and lions have manes: The acceptability of gender-specific
      minority generic sentences.
PG  - 1998-2020
LID - 10.1037/xlm0001081 [doi]
AB  - Minority characteristic generic statements such as ducks lay eggs are judged to
      be generally true of the class, despite being true of a minority of cases, such
      as healthy female ducks of egg-laying age. Five studies explored the factors
      responsible for the acceptance of minority generic statements about biological
      kinds. Studies 1 and 2 found that minority generic statements about animals that 
      are true of just 1 sex were no more likely to be accepted as true of the class
      than were statements true of just 1 of 2 subtypes, not differentiated by sex.
      Further studies showed that gender-specific properties are more often accepted
      when related to reproduction (ducks lay eggs) than to appearance (deer have
      antlers). It is proposed that reproductive properties are more easily interpreted
      as referring to the kinds themselves, on account of their role in naive
      biological theories of the kinds. The result supports the view that minority
      generics are accepted to the degree that they are embedded in naive theories of a
      biological kind. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2022 APA, all rights reserved).

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: To review and update the latest findings in diagnosis and
      management of ocular surface squamous neoplasia (OSSN). RECENT FINDINGS: OSSN is 
      the most common anterior segment neoplastic disease process. Several ocular
      surface imaging techniques have been developed for the early diagnosis and
      management of clinical and subclinical ocular surface squamous neoplasia,
      including high-resolution optical coherence tomography (HR-OCT), in vivo confocal
      microscopy, and ultrasound biomicroscopy. Treatment modalities include both
      surgical and medical management, with a recent trend towards primary and
      adjunctive pharmacotherapy. SUMMARY: There is increasing use of HR-OCT for the
      diagnosis and monitoring of clinical and subclinical OSSN lesions. Topical
      pharmacotherapy agents, including interferon alpha-2b, 5-fluorouracil, and
      mitomycin C, have demonstrable efficacy in the treatment of OSSN and their use
      may be dictated based upon tumor factors, patient factors, cost, and side effect 
      profile. Both surgical excision and adjunctive topical medications have excellent
      success, with the favored treatment method trending towards topical
      pharmacotherapy as primary therapy.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: The aim of this study was to determine the pooled estimate of
      Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase negative staphylococci and their
      antimicrobial-resistance in patients with wound infection. METHODS: Literature
      searches were carried out in the electronic biomedical databases and indexing
      services such as PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Science Direct, Web of Science and
      Google Scholar. Original records of research articles, available online from 1988
      to March 2020, addressing the rates and antimicrobial-resistance pattern of
      staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) and coagulase negative staphylococci (CoNS) in 
      patients with wound infection were identified and screened. Endnote citation
      manager software version X9 for windows was utilized to collect and organize
      search outcomes and for removal of duplicate articles. The relevant data were
      extracted from included studies using a format prepared in Microsoft Excel and
      exported to STATA 14.0 software for the outcome measures analyses and
      subgrouping. RESULTS: The electronic databases search yielded 378 studies, of
      which 39 met predefined inclusion criteria and included in the final analyses.
      The pooled estimate of wound infection was 36% [95% CI: 23-50%) for S. aureus and
      12% [95% CI: 9-14%) for CoNS. S. aureus exhibited a higher rate of resistance to 
      penicillin (84%), ampicillin (83%), amoxicillin (67%), methicillin (50%),
      cotrimoxazole (50%), tetracycline (61%), doxycycline (58%), chloramphenicol (49%)
      and erythromycin (45%). However, relative lower resistant rate was observed to
      Augmentin (amoxicillin-clavulanic acid) (35%), gentamicin (33%), norfloxacin
      (23%), ciprofloxacin (26%), ceftriaxone (36%), vancomycin (29%) and clindamycin
      (40%). Similarly, for CoNS there was high resistance to methicillin, 52% [95% CI:
      26-78%]) and other antibiotics, but lower resistance to clindamycin, 15% [95% CI:
      6-24]) and vancomycin, 22% [95% CI: 2-41%]). Ceftriaxone resistance was observed 
      with prevalence of 36% [95% CI: 21-50%] for S. aureus and 42% [95% CI: 29-55%]
      for CoNS. CONCLUSION: There was high resistance of staphylococci bacterial
      species to commonly used antimicrobials in the clinical settings in Ethiopia. It 
      is a high time to implement multitude strategies to contain the threat. Further
      research focusing on factors promoting resistance and the effect of resistance on
      treatment outcome studies on these virulent organisms are warranted.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tafenoquine is a long-acting 8-aminoquinoline approved for
      antimalarial prophylaxis for </=6 months. Additional data is needed to establish 
      the drug's longer-term safety profile, including potential ophthalmic or
      neuropsychiatric effects. METHOD: This was a randomized, double-blind,
      placebo-controlled trial in 600 healthy adults. Eligible subjects were randomized
      1:1 to receive tafenoquine 200 mg weekly (antimalarial prophylactic regimen) or
      placebo for 52 weeks. Scheduled safety visits occurred at Weeks 4, 12, 24, 52
      (dosing completed), and 64 (final follow-up). Safety assessments included
      ophthalmic changes, general and neuropsychiatric adverse events (AEs), and
      laboratory value changes. RESULTS: The percentage of subjects with a
      protocol-defined Serious Ophthalmic Safety Event was lower in the Tafenoquine
      Group (18.2%) versus the Placebo Group (19%, p = 0.308). There was no significant
      difference between the percentages of subjects with at least one AE in the
      Tafenoquine Group (91.0%) versus Placebo (89.9%, p = 0.65). Common AEs seen at a 
      significantly higher incidence for tafenoquine included reversible cornea
      verticillata (54.5%) and nausea (13.0%), leading to 0.0% and 0.7%
      discontinuations. Psychiatric AEs occurred at similar percentages in both study
      groups. Reversible changes in hemoglobin, methemoglobin, creatinine, and blood
      urea nitrogen (BUN) were noted. CONCLUSIONS: This study supports the safety of
      extended 52-week tafenoquine prophylaxis. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION

AB  - Cell-fate transition can be modeled by ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
      which describe the behavior of several molecules in interaction, and for which
      each stable equilibrium corresponds to a possible phenotype (or 'biological
      trait'). In this paper, we focus on simple ODE systems modeling two molecules
      which each negatively (or positively) regulate the other. It is well-known that
      such models may lead to monostability or multistability, depending on the
      selected parameters. However, extensive numerical simulations have led systems
      biologists to conjecture that in the vast majority of cases, there cannot be more
      than two stable points. Our main result is a proof of this conjecture. More
      specifically, we provide a criterion ensuring at most bistability, which is
      indeed satisfied by most commonly used functions. This includes Hill functions,
      but also a wide family of convex and sigmoid functions. We also determine which
      parameters lead to monostability, and which lead to bistability, by developing a 
      more general framework encompassing all our results.

      Classification (IECC) System.
PG  - 91-98

AB  - The International Endocervical adenocarcinoma Criteria and Classification (IECC) 
      categorizes tumors into human papilloma virus (HPV) associated (HPVA), not
      associated (NHPV), and invasive adenocarcinoma not otherwise specified (IA NOS). 
      HPVA and NHPV encompass 11 histotypes and an algorithm of mucin content, HPV
      ribonucleic acid (RNA), estrogen receptor and GATA3 is proposed for the diagnosis
      of most. In this study, the IECC algorithm's diagnoses were compared with
      hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) based IECC histotyping. Kappa statistics measured
      performance agreement. With additional markers, hierarchical clustering by random
      forest (RF) classification identified the most discriminating between tumor
      types, and investigated other algorithms. Three pathologists independently
      reviewed digitized H&E images of n=152 primary cervical adenocarcinomas for IECC 
      histotype and mucin content, and tissue microarrays for expression of HPV RNA by 
      in situ hybridization and 16 antibodies by immunohistochemistry. Results were
      finalized by consensus. There were n=113 HPVA, n=22 NHPV, and n=17 IA NOS. Mucin 
      was obvious in n=36 and limited in n=116. Among n=124 with satisfactory test
      results, HPV RNA was positive in n=96, estrogen receptor in n=72, and GATA3 in
      n=15. The IECC algorithm diagnosed n=99 which agreed with H&E histotyping in n=64
      for a fair kappa of 0.36 (95% confidence interval, 0.21-0.50): n=12 were
      undiagnosed and n=13 were IA NOS. Small sample sizes restricted RF to HPVA versus
      NHPV which were discriminated by p16, HPV RNA, and MUC6 with an area under the
      curve of 0.74 (95% confidence interval, 0.58-0.90). The IECC algorithm for
      histotyping under-performed. The RF algorithmin for categorization was favorable,
      but validation in larger studies and investigation of additional algorithms to
      discriminate between all IECC histotypes are needed.

AB  - We performed a detailed analysis of changes in the profiles of osmotic
      deformability using the method of gradient ektacytometry. Changes in all
      determinants that form the deformation properties of red blood cells in Wistar
      rats in the juvenile period and before puberty were determined. The dynamics of
      the formation of the rheological properties of the blood after birth is
      characterized by a wave-like change in the studied determinants. The changes are 
      explained by adaptive reactions to extrauterine life as a result of hematopoiesis
      activation and the transition of the red bone marrow to a new level of
      functioning with the predominant replacement of physiological reticulocytosis in 
      newborns with mature erythrocytes. The most critical period is from 10 days to 1 
      month after birth. Starting from the second month, the deformation parameters of 
      erythrocytes are stabilized.

TI  - Ophthalmic Trauma Correlation Matrix (OTCM): a potential novel tool for
      evaluation of concomitant ocular tissue damage in open globe injuries.
PG  - 1773-1778
LID - 10.1007/s00417-021-05491-8 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: To introduce a novel tool to investigate the correlation between
      concomitant injuries and primary open globe injury (OGI) in the setting of
      ophthalmic trauma, the "Ophthalmic Trauma Correlation Matrix" (OTCM). METHODS:
      Retrospective cohort review, performed at a tertiary referral eye care center in 
      Eastern Nepal, involving all eyes with OGI meeting the inclusion criteria from
      2015-2018. Clinical data including details of primary injury, concurrent
      injuries, and clinical course were noted from hospital medical records. A
      correlation matrix chart was devised using matrix correlation and Pearson's
      correlation coefficient. This chart was then used to evaluate the association of 
      the various injuries in the setting of OGI. RESULTS: A total of 109 eyes with OGI
      were included. Majority of the eyes (78, 71.6%) had zone I injuries, while most
      of the eyes (66, 60.6%) had penetrating injury. The most frequent concomitant
      injuries in all zones of OGI were traumatic lens injury (77, 70.64%), followed by
      hyphema (48, 44.03%), and vitreous hemorrhage (35, 32.11%). The most common
      concomitant injury associated with zone I was hyphema (0.873), while traumatic
      subluxation/cataract (0.894) and vitreous hemorrhage (0.972) were commonly
      associated with zone II and III, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: OTCM could be a
      useful tool to manage injuries related to the primary ocular injury. This
      additional information will aid in the prognostication, planning, and management 
      of OGI and potentially prevent repeat surgeries and inadequate treatments.

TI  - Predictors of response to TNF inhibitors in rheumatoid arthritis: an individual
      patient data pooled analysis of randomised controlled trials.
LID - e001882 [pii]
LID - 10.1136/rmdopen-2021-001882 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To identify patient characteristics associated with responsiveness to 
      tumour necrosis factor inhibitors (TNFi) in rheumatoid arthritis (RA). MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: Individual patient data from 29 randomised controlled trials (RCTs) 
      evaluating the efficacy of a TNFi versus placebo or conventional therapy were
      obtained. Response to treatment was assessed in subgroups according to the
      following baseline characteristics: smoking status, physical activity, sex, age, 
      body mass index, autoantibody profile, disease duration, high initial disease
      activity defined by Disease Activity Score on 28 joints (DAS28)(C reactive
      protein (CRP)) >5.1. The primary outcome was the between-treatment group
      difference in DAS28(CRP) change from baseline to 6 months. The secondary
      endpoints were the between-treatment group difference in final DAS28(CRP)
      measured until 6 months and EULAR response criteria until 6 months. Data from
      each RCT were then pooled by the Mantel-Haenszel method using a random effects
      model. A linear metaregression was also carried out on two data-sharing platforms
      separately to support the results. RESULTS: Individual data of 11 617 patients
      from 29 RCTs were analysed. Until 6 months, a significantly higher EULAR
      non-response rate was observed in obese patients (OR 0.52 vs 0.36 for non-obese, 
      p=0.01). A multivariable regression model performed on 7457 patients indicated
      that patients treated by TNFi had a final DAS28(CRP) decreased by 0.02 for each
      year of disease duration (p<0.001), and a 0.21 decreased for patients with a
      baseline DAS28(CRP) >5.1 (p<0.001). CONCLUSIONS: In RA, patients who are more
      responsive to TNFi are those who are non-obese, have a long disease duration and 
      have a high initial disease activity.

TI  - Lion and spotted hyena distributions within a buffer area of the Serengeti-Mara
      ecosystem.
PG  - 22289
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-01518-6 [doi]
AB  - Most large carnivore populations are declining due to anthropogenic activities
      including direct persecution, prey depletion, habitat loss and degradation.
      protected areas (PAs) can help maintain viable large carnivore populations;
      however, anthropogenic activities occurring near and within PA borders or edges
      can reduce their effectiveness. We investigated the influence of edge effects on 
      abundance of lions (Panthera leo) and spotted hyenas (Crocuta crocuta) in Maswa
      Game Reserve (MGR), a part of the Serengeti ecosystem in northern Tanzania. We
      conducted repeated call-ins to attract and enumerate lions and hyenas at 20
      stations in MGR during June-July 2017. We used N-mixture models to estimate hyena
      and lion abundance in relation to land cover and distance from the south-western 
      MGR borders which are adjacent to villages. We found lowest lion and hyena
      abundances by the south-western border, with abundance of both species increasing
      toward the eastern border adjacent to Serengeti National Park. Lions were
      uniformly distributed among land covers whereas hyenas were more abundant in
      woodlands. We suggest that reduced lion and hyena abundance near human
      settlements was in response to depleted prey, due to human actions. We recommend 
      ecologically compatible land uses and effective border patrols to mitigate these 
      adverse effects.

AB  - Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome 
      coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has already affected millions worldwide. The
      emergence of multiple SARS-CoV-2 variants may pose a significant threat to our
      efforts in controlling the pandemic. The impact of SARS-CoV-2 variants on the
      efficacy of available vaccines, therapeutics, and diagnostics is currently being 
      investigated. SARS-CoV-2 has been implicated to be originated from animals due to
      cross-species jumping and raises zoonotic concerns due to the potential for
      reintroduction into the human populations via interspecies transmission between
      humans and animals. Natural SARS-CoV-2 infections have been reported in domestic 
      animals (dog, cat, and ferret), captive animals (tiger, lion, snow leopard, puma,
      otter, and gorilla), and wild and farmed minks. Vaccination of domestic animals
      can prevent the possible introduction of SARS-CoV-2 into the feral population and
      subsequent transmission to wildlife. Although the need to vaccinate susceptible
      animal species, such as cats, minks, and great apes, might seem irrational from a
      public health standpoint, the successful elimination of SARS-CoV-2 will only be
      possible by controlling the transmission in all susceptible animal species. This 
      is necessary to prevent the re-emergence of SARS-CoV-2 in the future.

TI  - Reverse Intersystem Crossing of Single Deuterated Perylene Molecules in a
      Dibenzothiophene Matrix.
PG  - e202100679
LID - 10.1002/cphc.202100679 [doi]
AB  - Intersystem crossing to the long-lived metastable triplet state is often a strong
      limitation on fluorescence brightness of single molecules, particularly for
      perylene in various matrices. In this paper, we report on a strong
      excitation-induced reverse intersystem crossing (rISC), a process where single
      perylene molecules in a dibenzothiophene matrix recover faster from the triplet
      state, turning into bright emitters at saturated excitation powers. With a
      detailed study of single-molecule fluorescence autocorrelations, we quantify the 
      effect of rISC. The intrinsic lifetimes found for the two effective triplet
      states (8.5+/-0.4 ms and 64+/-12 ms) become significantly shorter, into the
      sub-millisecond range, as the excitation power increases and fluorescence
      brightness is ultimately enhanced at least fourfold. Our results are relevant for
      the understanding of triplet state manipulation of single-molecule quantum
      emitters and for markedly improving their brightness.

TI  - Attitudes Towards Polygenic Risk Testing in Individuals with Glaucoma.

LID - 10.1016/j.ogla.2021.11.002 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Glaucoma is the leading cause of irreversible blindness worldwide;
      however, vision loss resulting from glaucoma generally can be prevented through
      early identification and timely implementation of treatment. Recently, polygenic 
      risk scores (PRSs) have shown promise in stratifying individual risk and
      prognostication for primary open-angle glaucoma (POAG) to reduce disease burden. 
      Integrating PRS testing into clinical practice is becoming increasingly
      realistic; however, little is known about the attitudes of patients toward such
      testing. DESIGN: Cross-sectional, questionnaire-based study. PARTICIPANTS: Among 
      the participants in the Australian and New Zealand Registry of Advanced Glaucoma,
      2369 were invited to participate who fit the inclusion criteria of adults with a 
      diagnosis of POAG who had not received genetic results that explain their
      condition, were not known to be deceased, resided in Australia, and had agreed to
      receive correspondence. METHODS: One thousand one hundred sixty-nine individuals 
      (response rate, 49%) with POAG completed the survey evaluating their attitudes
      towards polygenic risk testing for glaucoma. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES:
      Sociodemographic, health, perception, and emotional factors were examined to
      assess associations with interest in PRS testing. Interest in PRS testing was
      evaluated through assessing likelihood to take the test to predict personal risk 
      of disease and disease severity, and whether the individual would recommend the
      test to family members or others. RESULTS: Our results show strong interest in
      the test, with 69.4% of individuals (798 of 1150) indicating a keenness in
      testing before diagnosis, had it been available. In particular, interest was seen
      in those from an urban area (odds ratio [OR], 1.70; 95% confidence interval [CI],
      1.15-2.49; P = 0.007), those who perceived their risk of developing glaucoma as
      higher (OR, 2.05; 95% CI, 1.28-3.29; P = 0.003), and those who were worried about
      developing glaucoma (OR, 2.07; 95% CI, 1.27-3.37; P = 0.004). People who were
      interested in testing were more likely to change their eye health-seeking
      intentions and to recommend testing to family members and others, as well as to
      undergo testing for prognostication. CONCLUSIONS: These findings will help to
      facilitate the clinical implementation of PRS testing for glaucoma to reduce
      irreversible vision loss.

AB  - PRACE (Partnership for Advanced Computing in Europe), an international
      not-for-profit association that brings together the five largest European
      supercomputing centers and involves 26 European countries, has allocated more
      than half a billion core hours to computer simulations to fight the COVID-19
      pandemic. Alongside experiments, these simulations are a pillar of research to
      assess the risks of different scenarios and investigate mitigation strategies.
      While the world deals with the subsequent waves of the pandemic, we present a
      reflection on the use of urgent supercomputing for global societal challenges and
      crisis management.

TI  - The Immune Landscape of Colorectal Cancer.
LID - 5545 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/cancers13215545 [doi]
AB  - While the clinical importance of CD8+ and CD3+ cells in colorectal cancer (CRC)
      is well established, the impact of other immune cell subsets is less well
      described. We sought to provide a detailed overview of the immune landscape of
      CRC in the largest study to date in terms of patient numbers and in situ analyzed
      immune cell types. Tissue microarrays from 536 patients were stained using
      multiplexed immunofluorescence panels, and fifteen immune cell subclasses,
      representing adaptive and innate immunity, were analyzed. Overall, therapy-naive 
      CRC patients clustered into an 'inflamed' and a 'desert' group. Most T cell
      subsets and M2 macrophages were enriched in the right colon (p-values
      0.046-0.004), while pDC cells were in the rectum (p = 0.008). Elderly patients
      had higher infiltration of M2 macrophages (p = 0.024). CD8+ cells were linked to 
      improved survival in colon cancer stages I-III (q = 0.014), while CD4+ cells had 
      the strongest impact on overall survival in metastatic CRC (q = 0.031). Finally, 
      we demonstrated repopulation of the immune infiltrate in rectal tumors post
      radiation, following an initial radiation-induced depletion. This study provides 
      a detailed analysis of the in situ immune landscape of CRC paving the way for
      better diagnostics and providing hints to better target the immune
      microenvironment.

TI  - Transcriptome Analysis of Pterygium and Pinguecula Reveals Evidence of Genomic
      Instability Associated with Chronic Inflammation.
LID - 12090 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms222112090 [doi]
AB  - Solar damage due to ultraviolet radiation (UVR) is implicated in the development 
      of two proliferative lesions of the ocular surface: pterygium and pinguecula.
      Pterygium and pinguecula specimens were collected, along with adjacent healthy
      conjunctiva specimens. RNA was extracted and sequenced. Pairwise comparisons were
      made of differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Computational methods were used
      for analysis. Transcripts from 18,630 genes were identified. Comparison of two
      subgroups of pterygium specimens uncovered evidence of genomic instability
      associated with inflammation and the immune response; these changes were also
      observed in pinguecula, but to a lesser extent. Among the top DEGs were four
      genes encoding tumor suppressors that were downregulated in pterygium: C10orf90, 
      RARRES1, DMBT1 and SCGB3A1; C10orf90 and RARRES1 were also downregulated in
      pinguecula. Ingenuity Pathway Analysis overwhelmingly linked DEGs to cancer for
      both lesions; however, both lesions are clearly still benign, as evidenced by the
      expression of other genes indicating their well-differentiated and non-invasive
      character. Pathways for epithelial cell proliferation were identified that
      distinguish the two lesions, as well as genes encoding specific pathway
      components. Upregulated DEGs common to both lesions, including KRT9 and TRPV3,
      provide a further insight into pathophysiology. Our findings suggest that
      pterygium and pinguecula, while benign lesions, are both on the pathological
      pathway towards neoplastic transformation.

TI  - Results of a 2021 French National Survey on Management of Patients with Advanced 
      Stage Epithelial Ovarian Cancer.
LID - 4829 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/jcm10214829 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of this study was to assess current French practices in the
      management of patients with advanced epithelial ovarian cancer. METHOD: a
      58-question electronic survey was distributed anonymously to the members of the
      SFOG (French Society of Gynaecological Oncology), GINECO-ARCAGY (National
      Investigators Group for Ovarian and Breast Cancer Studies in France) and
      FRANCOGYN (French research group in oncological and gynaecological surgery).
      Initial diagnostic workup and staging, pathological data, surgical data,
      treatments and follow-up strategies were assessed. RESULTS: a total of 107
      participants responded to emailed surveys. Most of the respondents were
      obstetrician-gynaecologists (37.4%), surgical oncologists (34.6%) and medical
      oncologists (17.8%). According to most (76.8%) participants, less than 50% of
      patients were eligible for primary debulking surgery (PDS). The LION study
      criteria were applied in 69.5% of cases during PDS and 39% after chemotherapy.
      The timing of BRCA testing was very heterogeneous and ranged from 1 to 6 months. 
      The use of bevacizumab as an adjuvant schedule was lower in cases of no residual 
      disease (for 54.5% of respondents) compared to cases of residual disease (for
      63.6% of respondents). In cases of BRCA1-2 mutations, olaparib was given by
      75.8-84.8% of respondents, whereas niraparib was given in cases of BRCA wild-type
      diseases. CONCLUSION: this survey provides an extensive and a unique review of
      current French practices in the management of patients with advanced epithelial
      ovarian cancer in 2021.

      Easy Cleaning.

LID - 10.5650/jos.ess21239 [doi]
AB  - We report on the synergic effect of surfactants and chelating agents on the
      mechanism to remove stubborn keratin grime (keratin-Ca), which is bound with
      calcium ions and one of the most difficult grimes to remove, in order to make it 
      easier to clean bathtubs in less time and with less scrubbing. Our approach was
      to focus on keratin swelling, which we achieved by applying aqueous solutions
      with chelating agents and anionic surfactants, the combination of which greatly
      improved the swelling ratio, resulting in quick, easy removal of keratin-Ca with 
      water rinsing and little scrubbing. For the swelling process, we added chelating 
      agents and anionic surfactants to swell the keratin-Ca by both capturing calcium 
      ions and improving solution permeation. Furthermore, we measured the structural
      change of the keratin-Ca during swelling by TD-NMR and confirmed that a certain
      combination of chelating agent and anionic surfactant improved swelling by
      affecting not only the amorphous part such as the keratin matrix, but also the
      crystalline part such as the intermediate filaments (IFs).

AB  - Equivalence class formation has been difficult to demonstrate in nonhumans, but
      one method that has been successful is a simple discrimination procedure in which
      contingencies associated with two sets of arbitrary discriminative stimuli are
      repeatedly reversed. Pigeons and sea lions shift responding after encountering
      the newly-reversed contingency with only a few set members, showing evidence of
      functional equivalence. We used this strategy to determine whether similar
      findings would occur in rats using olfactory stimuli. Rats were trained to
      nose-poke in the presence of six stimuli arbitrarily designated as members of the
      positive set; responses to the six members of the negative set were not
      reinforced. When discriminative performance was established, contingencies
      associated with each set were reversed and re-reversed each time subjects met a
      performance criterion. All subjects successfully acquired the concurrent simple
      discriminations and were exposed to between 12 and 60 reversals, but none showed 
      clear evidence of functional class formation until a final procedure in which the
      stimulus sets that had been in place were arbitrarily rearranged. Acquisition
      with these new stimulus sets was impaired, showing that class membership
      generated by the original stimulus sets interfered with learning the new ones,
      thus providing evidence of functional equivalence.

AB  - PURPOSE: Alike keratoconus (KC), keratoglobus (KG) and pellucid marginal
      degeneration (PMD) belong to ectatic corneal diseases. While there are numerous
      studies on keratoconus pathophysiology, there is no exact knowledge on genetic
      and pathophysiological background of KG and PMD, so far. It is not yet clarified,
      whether KG and PMD are independent clinical entities or represent different
      stages of the same disease. Our purpose was to investigate key parameters
      concerning collagen synthesis, intracellular LOX expression and inflammation in
      corneal stromal cells of KG and PMD subjects, in vitro. METHODS: Normal human
      keratocytes of corneas from the LIONS Cornea Bank Saar-Lor-Lux, Trier/Westpfalz
      and human keratocytes of KG and PMD patients were isolated and cultured as
      keratocytes. To examine Collagen I and V (Col I, Col V), heat shock protein 47
      (Hsp47), Lysyl Oxidase (LOX), nuclear factor kappa B (NF-kappaB) mRNA and protein
      expression in all cell types, quantitative PCR and Western blot analysis has been
      performed. RESULTS: Col5A1 mRNA expression was significantly lower in KG and PMD 
      keratocytes and LOX mRNA expression was significantly higher in KG-keratocytes,
      compared to controls. Col1A1, Hsp47 and NF-kappaB mRNA expression and the
      analyzed protein expressions did not differ from controls, in KG or PMD.
      CONCLUSIONS: Col5A1 mRNA expression is decreased in KG and PMD and LOX mRNA
      expression is increased in KG. Therefore, the pathophysiology of KG and PMD
      differs from KC and these seem to be from KC independent entities. The
      explanation of the peripheral corneal thinning in KG and PMD must be investigated
      in further studies.

TI  - MOUNTAIN LIONS (PUMA CONCOLOR) RESIST LONG-TERM DIETARY EXPOSURE TO CHRONIC
      WASTING DISEASE.
PG  - 40-49
LID - 10.7589/JWD-D-21-00029 [doi]
AB  - For nearly 18 yr, we evaluated susceptibility of captive mountain lions (Puma
      concolor) to chronic wasting disease (CWD) in the face of repeated exposure
      associated with consuming infected cervid carcasses. Three mountain lions with a 
      monomorphic prion protein gene (PRNP) sequence identical to that described
      previously for the species had access to parts of >/=432 infected carcasses
      during >/=2,013 feeding occasions, conservatively representing >14,000 kg of
      infected feed material, during May 2002 to March 2020. The proportion of diet in 
      infected carcass material averaged 43% overall but differed from year to year
      (minimally 11-74%). Most infected carcasses were mule deer (Odocoileus hemionus; 
      approximately 75%). We observed no clinical signs suggestive of progressive
      encephalopathy or other neurologic disease over the approximately 14.5-17.9 yr
      between first known exposure and eventual death. Histopathology revealed no
      spongiform changes or immunostaining suggestive of prion infection in multiple
      sections of nervous and lymphoid tissue. Similarly, none of 133 free-ranging
      mountain lion carcasses sampled opportunistically during 2004-20 showed
      immunostaining consistent with prion infection in sections of brainstem or lymph 
      node. These findings align with prior work suggesting that CWD-associated prions 
      face strong barriers to natural transmission among species outside the family
      Cervidae.

TI  - Lions and brown bears colonized North America in multiple synchronous waves of
      dispersal across the Bering Land Bridge.
LID - 10.1111/mec.16267 [doi]
AB  - The Bering Land Bridge connecting North America and Eurasia was periodically
      exposed and inundated by oscillating sea levels during the Pleistocene glacial
      cycles. This land connection allowed the intermittent dispersal of animals,
      including humans, between Western Beringia (far northeast Asia) and Eastern
      Beringia (northwest North America), changing the faunal community composition of 
      both continents. The Pleistocene glacial cycles also had profound impacts on
      temperature, precipitation and vegetation, impacting faunal community structure
      and demography. While these palaeoenvironmental impacts have been studied in many
      large herbivores from Beringia (e.g., bison, mammoths, horses), the Pleistocene
      population dynamics of the diverse guild of carnivorans present in the region are
      less well understood, due to their lower abundances. In this study, we analyse
      mitochondrial genome data from ancient brown bears (Ursus arctos; n = 103) and
      lions (Panthera spp.; n = 39), two megafaunal carnivorans that dispersed into
      North America during the Pleistocene. Our results reveal striking synchronicity
      in the population dynamics of Beringian lions and brown bears, with multiple
      waves of dispersal across the Bering Land Bridge coinciding with glacial periods 
      of low sea levels, as well as synchronous local extinctions in Eastern Beringia
      during Marine Isotope Stage 3. The evolutionary histories of these two taxa
      underline the crucial biogeographical role of the Bering Land Bridge in the
      distribution, turnover and maintenance of megafaunal populations in North
      America.

TI  - Cataract surgery and intraocular lens placement in patients with Fuchs corneal
      dystrophy: a review of the current literature.
PG  - 21-27
LID - 10.1097/ICU.0000000000000816 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Late-onset Fuchs endothelial corneal dystrophy (FECD) is seen 
      in approximately 4% of individuals over the age of 40. With the growing
      population of adults over the age of 65, ophthalmologists need to be aware of the
      preoperative, perioperative, and postoperative considerations involved in
      cataract surgery in Fuchs patients. RECENT FINDINGS: Management of cataract
      patients with FECD requires preoperative assessment of endothelial cell size,
      density, and morphology. Considerations for perioperative endothelial cell loss
      include patients with hyperopia and shallow anterior chambers,
      phacoemulsification technique, transfer of ultrasonic energy to the cornea,
      corneal-protective perioperative agents, as well as thermal and mechanical
      damage. SUMMARY: Ophthalmologists performing cataract surgery on patients with
      FECD must carefully consider the risks of endothelial cell loss during surgery
      and minimize the risk of corneal decompensation after surgery. Preoperative
      management should evaluate the severity of the FECD as well as individual factors
      such as cataract density, the health and thickness of the cornea, and the
      anterior chamber depth. Perioperative techniques, adjustments to biometry
      calculations, and intraocular lens (IOL) selection may help optimize visual
      outcomes and recovery time.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Physical activity has been suggested as a modifiable risk factor
      for postoperative recovery after major surgery. We aimed to further define the
      association between self-reported leisure time physical activity and
      postoperative complications and recovery on a group level. MATERIALS AND METHODS:
      An observational cohort analysis was performed within a randomized controlled
      trial. Patients >/=20 years with colorectal cancer were eligible. Between January
      2015 and May 2020, 761 participants were recruited. Leisure time physical
      activity was self-assessed on a four-grade scale. The primary outcome in this
      analysis was postoperative complications within 90 days, measured with the
      comprehensive complication index (CCI). Secondary outcomes were CCI for the index
      hospital stay, CCI 30 days postoperatively, specific types of complications,
      length of hospital stay, and self-assessed physical recovery. Analyses were
      adjusted for gender, age, study center, alcohol consumption, tumor stage,
      colon/rectal cancer, neoadjuvant therapy, and open or laparoscopic surgery.
      RESULTS: Data on preoperative physical activity was available for 614
      participants. Participants who reported some physical activity had on average a
      lower CCI 90 days postoperatively than sedentary participants (odds ratio 0.63,
      95% CI 0.43-0.92). Similar patterns were shown for complications during hospital 
      stay and within 30 days. There were trends towards lower risk for several types
      of complications, reoperations and length of hospital stay but the only
      difference shown was for respiratory insufficiency. CONCLUSION: Physically active
      participants experienced fewer postoperative complications, which suggests the
      information has a potential prognostic value. The work for increasing physical
      activity in the general population should continue.

AB  - The design and development of a computer-based system for breast cancer detection
      are largely reliant on feature selection techniques. These techniques are used to
      reduce the dimensionality of the feature space by removing irrelevant or
      redundant features from the original set. This article presents a hybrid feature 
      selection method that is based on the Butterfly optimization algorithm (BOA) and 
      the Ant Lion optimizer (ALO) to form a hybrid BOAALO method. The optimal subset
      of features chosen by BOAALO is utilized to predict the benign or malignant
      status of breast tissue using three classifiers: artificial neural network,
      adaptive neuro-fuzzy inference system, and support vector machine. The goodness
      of the proposed method is tested using 651 mammogram images. The results show
      that BOAALO outperforms the original BOA and ALO in terms of accuracy,
      sensitivity, specificity, kappa value, type-I, and type-II error as well as the
      receiver operating characteristics curve. Additionally, the suggested method's
      robustness is assessed and compared to five well-known methods using a benchmark 
      dataset. The experimental findings demonstrate that BOAALO achieves a high degree
      of accuracy with a minimum number of features. These results support the
      suggested method's applicability for breast cancer diagnosis.

TI  - Gastrointestinal Development and Microbiota Responses of Geese to Honeycomb
      Flavonoids Supplementation.
PG  - 739237
LID - 10.3389/fvets.2021.739237 [doi]
AB  - Background: Geese are conventionally considered to be herbivorous, which could
      also be raised with concentrate feeding diets without green grass because of the 
      similar gastrointestinal tract with other poultry. However, the geese gut
      microbiota profiles and their interactions with epithelial cells are still of
      limited study. Flavonoids were well-documented to shape gut microbiota and
      promote epithelial barrier functions individually or cooperatively with other
      metabolites. Therefore, in the present study, honeycomb flavonoids (HF) were
      supplemented to investigate the effects on growth performances, intestinal
      development, and gut microbiome of geese. Material and Methods: A total of 400
      1-day-old male lion-head geese with similar birth weight (82.6 +/- 1.4 g) were
      randomly divided into five treatments: the control treatment (CON) and the HF
      supplementation treatments, HF was supplemented arithmetically to increase from
      0.25 to 1%. Growth performance, carcass performances, and intestines' development
      parameters were measured to determine the optimum supplement. Junction proteins
      including ZO-1 and ZO-2 and cecal microbiota were investigated to demonstrate the
      regulatory effects of HF on both microbiota and intestinal epithelium. Results:
      Results showed that 0.5% of HF supplement had superior growth performance,
      carcass performance, and the total parameters of gastrointestinal development to 
      other treatments. Further research showed that tight junction proteins including 
      ZO-1 and ZO-2 significantly up-regulated, while Firmicutes and some probiotics
      including Clostridiales, Streptococcus, Lachnoclostridium, and Bifidobacterium,
      remarkably proliferated after HF supplement. In conclusion, HF supplement in
      concentrate-diet feeding geese effectively increased the growth performances by
      regulating the gut microbiota to increase the probiotic abundance to promote the 
      nutrient digestibility and fortify the epithelial development and barrier
      functions to facilitate the nutrient absorption and utilization.

TI  - Overexpressing Kallistatin Aggravates Experimental Autoimmune Uveitis Through
      Promoting Th17 Differentiation.
PG  - 756423
LID - 10.3389/fimmu.2021.756423 [doi]
AB  - Kallistatin or kallikrein-binding protein (KBP) has been reported to regulate
      angiogenesis, inflammation and tumor progression. Autoimmune uveitis is a common,
      sight-threatening inflammatory intraocular disease. However, the roles of
      kallistatin in autoimmunity and autoreactive T cells are poorly investigated.
      Compared to non-uveitis controls, we found that plasma levels of kallistatin were
      significantly upregulated in patients with Vogt-Koyanagi-Harada (VKH) disease,
      one of the non-infectious uveitis. Using an experimental autoimmune uveitis (EAU)
      model induced by human interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein peptide
      651-670 (hIRBP651-670), we examined the effects of kallistatin on the
      pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases. Compared to wild type (WT) mice, kallistatin
      transgenic (KS) mice developed severe uveitis with dominant Th17 infiltrates in
      the eye. In addition, the proliferative antigen-specific T cells isolated from KS
      EAU mice produced increased levels of IL-17A, but not IFN-gamma or IL-10
      cytokines. Moreover, splenic CD4(+) T cells from naive KS mice expressed higher
      levels of Il17a mRNA compared to WT naive mice. Under Th17 polarization
      conditions, KS mice exhibited enhanced differentiation of naive CD4(+) T cells
      into Th17 cells compared to WT controls. Together, our results indicate that
      kallistatin promotes Th17 differentiation and is a key regulator of aggravating
      autoinflammation in EAU. Targeting kallistatin might be a potential to treat
      autoimmune disease.

LID - 10.1098/rspb.2021.1871 [doi]
AB  - It is time to acknowledge and overcome conservation's deep-seated systemic
      racism, which has historically marginalized Black, Indigenous and people of
      colour (BIPOC) communities and continues to do so. We describe how the mutually
      reinforcing 'twin spheres' of conservation science and conservation practice
      perpetuate this systemic racism. We trace how institutional structures in
      conservation science (e.g. degree programmes, support and advancement
      opportunities, course syllabuses) can systematically produce conservation
      graduates with partial and problematic conceptions of conservation's history and 
      contemporary purposes. Many of these graduates go on to work in conservation
      practice, reproducing conservation's colonial history by contributing to
      programmes based on outmoded conservation models that disproportionately harm
      rural BIPOC communities and further restrict access and inclusion for BIPOC
      conservationists. We provide practical, actionable proposals for breaking vicious
      cycles of racism in the system of conservation we have with virtuous cycles of
      inclusion, equality, equity and participation in the system of conservation we
      want.

      RESULTS: Clinical signs were highly variable and associated with polyphasic
      rhabdomyositis attributed to Sarcocystis neurona infection. Generalized severe
      muscle wasting, respiratory compromise, and regurgitation secondary to
      megaesophagus were the most profound clinical findings. Respiratory compromise
      and megaesophagus were associated with a poor prognosis. Eight of the 38 sea
      lions were treated and released to the wild, and 2 subsequently restranded and
      were euthanized. Two additional animals received no targeted treatment and were
      released. The remaining 28 animals were either euthanized or died during
      treatment. CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Results suggested that unlike
      other marine mammals, which typically develop encephalitis, California sea lions 
      with sarcocystosis often have polyphasic rhabdomyositis with highly variable
      clinical signs and that extensive diagnostic testing may be required to confirm
      the diagnosis. Treatment with an antiprotozoal drug in combination with
      corticosteroids may resolve clinical disease, but the prognosis is guarded.

TI  - Delayed Perforation of an Intrastromal Corneal Ring Segment into the Anterior
      Chamber: A Case Report and Review of the Literature.
PG  - 740-748
LID - 10.1159/000518012 [doi]
AB  - Intrastromal corneal ring segments (ICRSs) are an effective treatment for
      stabilizing and normalizing corneal shape in patients with keratoconus and other 
      corneal ectasias. Intraoperative segment perforation through the corneal
      endothelium into the anterior chamber (AC) is an uncommon but known complication.
      However, perforation into the AC postoperatively is an exceedingly rare
      complication with only 3 reported cases in the literature. One case was due to
      Descemet membrane detachment and another due to ocular trauma. In the third case,
      the mechanism for perforation was unclear. We present the fourth case of delayed 
      ICRS perforation due to silent migration through the endothelium into the AC. We 
      also present all reported cases in the literature of intraoperative and
      postoperative perforation into the AC.

TI  - Asymptotic Stability of Minkowski Space-Time with Non-compactly Supported
      Massless Vlasov Matter.
PG  - 1-147
LID - 10.1007/s00205-021-01639-2 [doi]
AB  - We prove the global asymptotic stability of the Minkowski space for the massless 
      Einstein-Vlasov system in wave coordinates. In contrast with previous work on the
      subject, no compact support assumptions on the initial data of the Vlasov field
      in space or the momentum variables are required. In fact, the initial decay in v 
      is optimal. The present proof is based on vector field and weighted vector field 
      techniques for Vlasov fields, as developed in previous work of Fajman, Joudioux, 
      and Smulevici, and heavily relies on several structural properties of the
      massless Vlasov equation, similar to the null and weak null conditions. To deal
      with the weak decay rate of the metric, we propagate well-chosen hierarchized
      weighted energy norms which reflect the strong decay properties satisfied by the 
      particle density far from the light cone. A particular analytical difficulty
      arises at the top order, when we do not have access to improved pointwise decay
      estimates for certain metric components. This difficulty is resolved using a
      novel hierarchy in the massless Einstein-Vlasov system, which exploits the
      propagation of different growth rates for the energy norms of different metric
      components.

TI  - The E3 ligase COP1 promotes ERalpha signaling and suppresses EMT in breast
      cancer.
PG  - 173-190
LID - 10.1038/s41388-021-02038-3 [doi]
AB  - ERalpha signaling drives proliferation, survival and cancer initiation in the
      mammary gland. Therefore, it is critical to elucidate mechanisms by which ERalpha
      expression is regulated. We show that the tumor suppressor E3 ligase COP1
      promotes the degradative polyubiquitination of the microtubule-associated protein
      HPIP. As such, COP1 negatively regulates estrogen-dependent AKT activation in
      breast cancer cells. However, COP1 also induces ERalpha expression and
      ERalpha-dependent gene transcription, at least through c-Jun degradation. COP1
      and ERalpha levels are positively correlated in clinical cases of breast cancer. 
      COP1 also supports the metabolic reprogramming by estrogens, including
      glycolysis. On the other hand, COP1 suppresses EMT in breast cancer cells. COP1
      deficiency also contributes to Tamoxifen resistance, at least through protective 
      autophagy. Therefore, COP1 acts as an oncogenic E3 ligase by promoting ERalpha
      signaling but also acts as a tumor suppressor candidate by preventing EMT, which 
      reflects a dual role of COP1 in breast cancer.

AB  - Ten Bifidobacterium strains, i.e., 6T3, 64T4, 79T10, 80T4, 81T8, 82T1, 82T10,
      82T18, 82T24, and 82T25, were isolated from mantled guereza (Colobus guereza),
      Sumatran orangutan (Pongo abeli), silvery marmoset (Mico argentatus), golden lion
      tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia), pied tamarin (Saguinus bicolor), and common
      pheasant (Phaisanus colchinus). Cells are Gram-positive, non-motile,
      non-sporulating, facultative anaerobic, and fructose 6-phosphate
      phosphoketolase-positive. Phylogenetic analyses based on the core genome
      sequences revealed that isolated strains exhibit close phylogenetic relatedness
      with Bifidobacterium genus members belonging to the Bifidobacterium bifidum,
      Bifidobacterium longum, Bifidobacterium pullorum, and Bifidobacterium tissieri
      phylogenetic groups. Phenotypic characterization and genotyping based on the
      genome sequences clearly show that these strains are distinct from each of the
      type strains of the so far recognized Bifidobacterium species. Thus, B. phasiani 
      sp. nov. (6T3 = LMG 32224(T) = DSM 112544(T)), B. pongonis sp. nov. (64T4 = LMG

      112548(T)), pluvialisilvae sp. nov. (82T24 = LMG 32229(T) = DSM 112545(T)), and
      B. miconisargentati sp. nov. (82T25 = LMG 32283(T) = DSM 112546(T)) are proposed

AB  - Long-term studies of mountain lions (Puma concolor) in Southern California have
      documented persistent small population sizes and the lowest genetic variation of 
      any mountain lion population, except for the Federally endangered mountain lion
      subspecies, the Florida panther (Puma concolor coryi). There is overwhelming
      molecular evidence supporting inbreeding and low genetic diversity in these
      Southern California populations but there is a lack of phenotypical evidence of
      inbreeding depression. The primary goal of this study was to assess male mountain
      lions, in Southern California, for teratospermia (>60% abnormal sperm
      production), one of the first signs of inbreeding depression in mountain lions
      that are associated with decreased reproduction and population decline. From
      December 2019 to December 2020, we surveyed mountain lions during live captures, 
      after mortality events, and in images collected from camera traps in the
      following populations: Santa Monica Mountains, Santa Susana Mountains, Santa Ana 
      Mountains, and the Eastern Peninsular Range. Mountain lions were sampled for
      known physical abnormalities associated with inbreeding depression such as
      teratospermia, cryptorchidism, and distal tail kinks. For teratospermia, we
      extracted testes from five males post-mortem to assess sperm morphology.
      Epididymal sperm evaluations revealed all males were teratospermic. Across all
      samples, on average, 93% of observed spermatozoa were abnormal. We physically
      examined 32 mountain lions (males and females) for distal tail kinks, and we
      observed one individual affected. We examined 15 male mountain lions for
      cryptorchidism, and we observed one unilaterally cryptorchid male and one male
      with testes that differed significantly in size, likely reflecting asynchronous
      migration of the testes during puberty. Further, we identified three other
      animals in camera-trap images that had distal tail kinks, for a total of four. In
      conclusion, from December 2019 to December 2020, we identified nine individuals
      exhibiting physical signs of inbreeding depression. These reproductive and
      physical signs of inbreeding depression in Southern California mountain lions
      increase the urgency of conservation efforts in the region.

TI  - Analysis of maternal and newborn training curricula and approaches to inform
      future trainings for routine care, basic and comprehensive emergency obstetric
      and newborn care in the low- and middle-income countries: Lessons from Ethiopia
      and Nepal.

AB  - Program managers routinely design and implement specialised maternal and newborn 
      health trainings for health workers in low- and middle-income countries to
      provide better-coordinated care across the continuum of care. However, in these
      countries details on the availability of different training packages, skills
      covered in those training packages and the gaps in their implementation are
      patchy. This paper presents an assessment of maternal and newborn health training
      packages to describe differences in training contents and implementation
      approaches used for a range of training packages in Ethiopia and Nepal. We
      conducted a mixed-methods study. The quantitative assessment was conducted using 
      a comprehensive assessment questionnaire based on validated WHO guidelines and
      developed jointly with global maternal and newborn health experts. The
      qualitative assessment was conducted through key informant interviews with
      national stakeholders involved in implementing these training packages and
      working with the Ministries of Health in both countries. Our quantitative
      analysis revealed several key gaps in the technical content of maternal and
      newborn health training packages in both countries. Our qualitative results from 
      key informant interviews provided additional insights by highlighting several
      issues with trainings related to quality, skill retention, logistics, and
      management. Taken together, our findings suggest four key areas of improvement:
      first, training materials should be updated based on the content gaps identified 
      and should be aligned with each other. Second, trainings should address actual
      health worker performance gaps using a variety of innovative approaches such as
      blended and self-directed learning. Third, post-training supervision and ongoing 
      mentoring need to be strengthened. Lastly, functional training information
      systems are required to support planning efforts in both countries.

TI  - Behavior of hyperreflective spots noted on optical coherence tomography following
      intravitreal therapy in diabetic macular edema: A systematic review and
      meta-analysis.
PG  - 3208-3217
LID - 10.4103/ijo.IJO_1155_21 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Hyperreflective spots (HRS) are considered as spectral domain optical
      coherence tomography biomarkers in predicting response to intravitreal therapy
      (IVT) in diabetic macular edema (DME). We aimed to determine if there was a
      quantitative reduction in HRS following IVT in DME, if the response to
      antivascular endothelial growth factor (anti-VEGF) drugs was different from
      steroids, and if HRS-response was associated with improvement in visual acuity
      (VA) or reduction in central macular thickness (CMT). METHODS: PubMed/MEDLINE,
      Scopus, ProQuest, CINAHL, Wiley online, and Web of Science were searched (between
      January 1, 2011 and July 1, 2020). Publication bias and heterogeneity were
      assessed. Meta-analysis was done using the random-effects model. RESULTS:
      Totally, 1168 eyes from 19 studies were eligible for inclusion. IVT was
      associated with a reduction in quantitative HRS (z = -6.3, P < 0.0001). Studies, 
      however, showed heterogeneity (I(2) = 93.2%). There was no difference between
      anti-VEGF and steroid therapies (P = 0.23). The evidence on predicting VA and CMT
      outcomes were limited by the number of analyzable studies, owing to the wide
      variation in individual study designs, and lack of randomized controlled trials. 
      CONCLUSION: We could conclude that there is a definite reduction in quantitative 
      HRS following either form of IVT. We highlight the lacunae in the existing
      literature on HRS in DME and propose goals for future studies to harness the
      advantage of this promising biomarker.

TI  - The impact of improved road networks on marketing of vegetables and households'
      income in Dedo district, Oromia regional state, Ethiopia.

AB  - Rural infrastructures are important factors which are involved in agricultural
      development in Ethiopia. Among them, rural road facilities play a very
      significant role in the improvement of agricultural production and household
      income. This is because a good rural road network hurries efficient delivery of
      agricultural farm input and creates an opportunity to supply product to market.
      Currently, poor road conditions are hindering supply of product to market, which 
      in turn affects households' annual income in most rural areas of Ethiopia.
      Therefore, this study aimed to asses the impact of improved road networks on
      marketing of vegetables and households' income in Dedo district in Ethiopia. For 
      the study, two kebele were selected and data were collected from randomly
      selected 176 households from two kebele in the district. In addition to this, key
      informant interviews and focus group discussions were also conducted. Data were
      analyzed by multiple response tests and multiple linear regression models on
      statistical packages of the social sciences (SPSS). Study found that, from the
      total annual income of households; 58.5% of income was earned from vegetable
      production and it takes a lion share of households' annual income in the study
      area. Regression results revealed that independent variables in the study had an 
      insignificant influence on rural household annual income (p < 0.05). The multiple
      correlation coefficient measure (R = 0.845) also indicates that the relationship 
      between rural household annual income and independent (set of explanatory)
      variables was strongly correlated. Findings also expose that high transportation 
      costs incurring, spoilage of the product, deprived extension, service and market 
      information, and reduction of household income are among the major impacts of
      road infrastructure in the district. Therefore, study suggested that rural
      households must have gained road access and federal and local road authorities
      should give attention to rural area road infrastructural development.

AB  - The entry inhibitor bulevirtide (BLV) received conditional approval from the EMA 
      in July 2020 for the treatment of adult patients with compensated chronic
      hepatitis delta. However, the effectiveness and safety of BLV administered as
      monotherapy beyond 48 weeks in difficult-to-treat patients with HDV-related
      cirrhosis is presently unknown. Herein, we describe the first patients with
      HDV-related compensated cirrhosis who were treated with BLV (10 mg/day as a
      starting dose) for up to 3 years on a compassionate use program. Patients were
      also monitored for HBcrAg and HBV RNA levels, and HDV- and HBV-specific T-cell
      markers. In the patient who stopped BLV at week 48, after achieving a virological
      and biochemical response, the initial virological and biochemical rebound was
      followed by alanine aminotransferase normalization coupled with low HDV RNA and
      HBsAg levels. In the 2 patients treated continuously for 3 years, virological and
      biochemical responses were maintained throughout the treatment period even after 
      dose reduction. In a patient with advanced compensated cirrhosis, liver function 
      tests significantly improved, esophageal varices disappeared, and
      histological/laboratory features of autoimmune hepatitis resolved. Overall, no
      safety issues were recorded, as bile salt increase was asymptomatic. While serum 
      HBV RNA levels remained undetectable in all patients, HBV core-related antigen
      levels showed a progressive, yet modest decline during long-term BLV treatment.
      No HDV-specific interferon-gamma-producing T cells were detected, neither after
      HDV reactivation (after BLV withdrawn in Patient 1) nor during 3 years of BLV
      treatment. In conclusion, this report shows that continuous administration of BLV
      monotherapy for 3 years leads to excellent virological and clinical responses in 
      patients with HDV-related cirrhosis who had contraindications to interferon-based

AB  - Purpose: Emmetropization requires coordinated scaling of the major ocular
      components, corneal curvature and axial length. This coordination is achieved in 
      part through a shared set of genetic variants that regulate eye size. Poorly
      coordinated scaling of corneal curvature and axial length results in refractive
      error. We tested the hypothesis that genetic variants regulating eye size in
      emmetropic eyes are distinct from those conferring susceptibility to refractive
      error. Methods: A genome-wide association study (GWAS) for corneal curvature in
      22,180 adult emmetropic individuals was performed as a proxy for a GWAS for eye
      size. A polygenic score created using lead GWAS variants was tested for
      association with corneal curvature and axial length in an independent sample: 437
      classified as emmetropic and 637 as ametropic. The genetic correlation between
      eye size and refractive error was calculated using linkage disequilibrium score
      regression for approximately 1 million genetic variants. Results: The GWAS for
      corneal curvature in emmetropes identified 32 independent genetic variants (P <
      5.0e-08). A polygenic score created using these 32 genetic markers explained 3.5%
      (P < 0.001) and 2.0% (P = 0.001) of the variance in corneal curvature and axial
      length, respectively, in the independent sample of emmetropic individuals but was
      not predictive of these traits in ametropic individuals. The genetic correlation 
      between eye size and refractive error was close to zero (rg = 0.00; SE = 0.06; P 
      = 0.95). Conclusions: These results support the hypothesis that genetic variants 
      regulating eye size in emmetropic eyes do not overlap with those conferring
      susceptibility to myopia. This suggests that distinct biological pathways
      regulate normal eye growth and myopia development.

TI  - Comparative examination of pinniped craniofacial musculature and its role in
      aquatic feeding.
PG  - 226-252
LID - 10.1111/joa.13557 [doi]
AB  - Secondarily aquatic tetrapods have many unique morphologic adaptations for life
      underwater compared with their terrestrial counterparts. A key innovation during 
      the land-to-water transition was feeding. Pinnipeds, a clade of air-breathing
      marine carnivorans that include seals, sea lions, and walruses, have evolved
      multiple strategies for aquatic feeding (e.g., biting, suction feeding). Numerous
      studies have examined the pinniped skull and dental specializations for
      underwater feeding. However, data on the pinniped craniofacial musculoskeletal
      system and its role in aquatic feeding are rare. Therefore, the objectives of
      this study were to conduct a comparative analysis of pinniped craniofacial
      musculature and examine the function of the craniofacial musculature in
      facilitating different aquatic feeding strategies. We performed anatomic
      dissections of 35 specimens across six pinniped species. We describe 32 pinniped 
      craniofacial muscles-including facial expression, mastication, tongue, hyoid, and
      soft palate muscles. Pinnipeds broadly conform to mammalian patterns of
      craniofacial muscle morphology. Pinnipeds also exhibit unique musculoskeletal
      morphologies-in muscle position, attachments, and size-that likely represent
      adaptations for different aquatic feeding strategies. Suction feeding specialists
      (bearded and northern elephant seals) have a significantly larger masseter than
      biters. Further, northern elephant seals have large and unique tongue and hyoid
      muscle morphologies compared with other pinniped species. These morphologic
      changes likely help generate and withstand suction pressures necessary for
      drawing water and prey into the mouth. In contrast, biting taxa (California sea
      lions, harbor, ringed, and Weddell seals) do not exhibit consistent craniofacial 
      musculoskeletal adaptations that differentiate them from suction feeders.
      Generally, we discover that all pinnipeds have well-developed and robust
      craniofacial musculature. Pinniped head musculature plays an important role in
      facilitating different aquatic feeding strategies. Together with behavioral and
      kinematic studies, our data suggest that pinnipeds' robust facial morphology
      allows animals to switch feeding strategies depending on the environmental
      context-a critical skill in a heterogeneous and rapidly changing underwater
      habitat.

TI  - Transmission dynamics and susceptibility patterns of SARS-CoV-2 in domestic,
      farmed and wild animals: Sustainable One Health surveillance for conservation and
      public health to prevent future epidemics and pandemics.
LID - 10.1111/tbed.14356 [doi]
AB  - The exact origin of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) 
      and source of introduction into humans has not been established yet, though it
      might be originated from animals. Therefore, we conducted a study to understand
      the putative reservoirs, transmission dynamics, and susceptibility patterns of
      SARS-CoV-2 in animals. Rhinolophus bats are presumed to be natural progenitors of
      SARS-CoV-2-related viruses. Initially, pangolin was thought to be the source of
      spillover to humans, but they might be infected by human or other animal species.
      So, the virus spillover pathways to humans remain unknown. Human-to-animal
      transmission has been testified in pet, farmed, zoo and free-ranging wild
      animals. Infected animals can transmit the virus to other animals in natural
      settings like mink-to-mink and mink-to-cat transmission. Animal-to-human
      transmission is not a persistent pathway, while mink-to-human transmission
      continues to be illuminated. Multiple companions and captive wild animals were
      infected by an emerging alpha variant of concern (B.1.1.7 lineage) whereas
      Asiatic lions were infected by delta variant, (B.1.617.2). To date, multiple
      animal species - cat, ferrets, non-human primates, hamsters and bats - showed
      high susceptibility to SARS-CoV-2 in the experimental condition, while swine,
      poultry, cattle showed no susceptibility. The founding of SARS-CoV-2 in wild
      animal reservoirs can confront the control of the virus in humans and might carry
      a risk to the welfare and conservation of wildlife as well. We suggest
      vaccinating pets and captive animals to stop spillovers and spillback events. We 
      recommend sustainable One Health surveillance at the animal-human-environmental
      interface to detect and prevent future epidemics and pandemics by Disease X.

TI  - Contrasting patterns of risk from human and non-human predators shape temporal
      activity of prey.

AB  - Spatiotemporal variation in predation risk arises from interactions between
      landscape heterogeneity, predator densities and predator hunting mode, generating
      landscapes of fear for prey species that can have important effects on prey
      behaviour and ecosystem dynamics. As widespread apex predators, humans present a 
      significant source of risk for hunted animal populations. Spatiotemporal patterns
      of risk from hunters can overlap or contrast with patterns of risk from other
      predators. Human infrastructure can also reshape spatial patterns of risk by
      facilitating or impeding hunter or predator movement, or deterring predators that
      are themselves wary of humans. We examined how anthropogenic and natural
      landscape features interact with hunting modes of rifle hunters and mountain
      lions Puma concolor to generate spatiotemporal patterns of risk for their primary
      prey. We explored the implications of human-modified landscapes of fear for
      Columbian black-tailed deer Odocoileus hemionus columbianus in Mendocino County, 
      California. We used historical harvest records, hunter GPS trackers and camera
      trap records of mountain lions to model patterns of risk for deer. We then used
      camera traps to examine deer spatial and temporal activity patterns in response
      to this variation in risk. Hunters and mountain lions exhibited distinct,
      contrasting patterns of spatiotemporal activity. Risk from rifle hunters, who
      rely on long lines of sight, was highest in open grasslands and near roads and
      was confined to the daytime. Risk from mountain lions, an ambush predator, was
      highest in dense shrubland habitat, farther from developed areas, and during the 
      night and crepuscular periods. Areas of human settlement provided a refuge from
      both hunters and mountain lions. We found no evidence that deer avoided risk in
      space at the scale of our observations, but deer adjusted their temporal activity
      patterns to reduce the risk of encounters with humans and mountain lions in areas
      of higher risk. Our study demonstrates that interactions between human
      infrastructure, habitat cover and predator hunting mode can result in distinct
      spatial patterns of predation risk from hunters and other predators that may lead
      to trade-offs for prey species. However, distinct diel activity patterns of
      predators may create vacant hunting domains that reduce costly trade-offs for
      prey. Our study highlights the importance of temporal partitioning as a mechanism
      of predation risk avoidance.

AB  - Despite significant advances in oncological research, cancer nowadays remains one
      of the main causes of mortality and morbidity worldwide. New treatment
      techniques, as a rule, have limited efficacy, target only a narrow range of
      oncological diseases, and have limited availability to the general public due
      their high cost. An important goal in oncology is thus the modification of the
      types of antitumor therapy and their combinations, that are already introduced
      into clinical practice, with the goal of increasing the overall treatment
      efficacy. One option to achieve this goal is optimization of the schedules of
      drugs administration or performing other medical actions. Several factors
      complicate such tasks: the adverse effects of treatments on healthy cell
      populations, which must be kept tolerable; the emergence of drug resistance due
      to the intrinsic plasticity of heterogeneous cancer cell populations; the
      interplay between different types of therapies administered simultaneously.
      Mathematical modeling, in which a tumor and its microenvironment are considered
      as a single complex system, can address this complexity and can indicate
      potentially effective protocols, that would require experimental verification. In
      this review, we consider classical methods, current trends and future prospects
      in the field of mathematical modeling of tumor growth and treatment. In
      particular, methods of treatment optimization are discussed with several examples
      of specific problems related to different types of treatment.

TI  - THE USE OF EPHEDRINE TO TREAT ANESTHESIA-ASSOCIATED HYPOTENSION IN PINNIPEDS.
PG  - 1054-1060
LID - 10.1638/2020-0219 [doi]
AB  - Hypotension is a common adverse effect of general anesthesia that has
      historically been difficult to measure in pinniped species due to technical
      challenges. A retrospective case review found seven pinniped cases that
      demonstrated anesthesia-associated hypotension diagnosed by direct blood pressure
      measurements during general anesthesia at The Marine Mammal Center (Sausalito,
      CA) between 2017 and 2019. Cases included five California sea lions (CSL:
      Zalophus californianus), one Hawaiian monk seal (HMS: Neomonachus schauinslandi),
      and one northern elephant seal (NES: Mirounga angustirostris). Patients were
      induced using injectable opioids, benzodiazepines, and anesthetics including
      propofol and alfaxalone. Excluding the HMS, all patients required supplemental
      isoflurane with a mask to achieve an anesthetic plane allowing for intubation.
      Each patient was maintained with inhalant isoflurane in oxygen for the duration
      of the anesthetic event. Each patient was concurrently administered continuous IV
      fluids and four patients received fluid boluses prior to administration of
      ephedrine. All hypotensive anesthetized patients were treated with IV ephedrine
      (0.05-0.2 mg/kg). The average initial systolic (SAP) and mean (MAP) arterial
      blood pressures for the CSL prior to ephedrine administration were 71 +/- 14 mmHg
      and 48 +/- 12 mmHg respectively. The average SAP and MAP for the CSL increased to
      119 +/- 32 mmHg and 90 +/- 34 mmHg respectively within 5 m of ephedrine
      administration. The NES initial blood pressure measurement was 59/43 (50)
      (SAP/diastolic [MAP]) mmHg and increased to 80/51 (62) mmHg within 5 m. The
      initial HMS blood pressure was 79/68 (73) mmHg and increased to 99/78 (85) mmHg
      within 5 m following ephedrine administration. All patients recovered from
      anesthesia. These results support the efficacy of IV ephedrine for the treatment 
      of anesthesia-associated hypotension in pinnipeds.

TI  - OPTIMIZING A PLATELET-RICH PLASMA CONCENTRATION PROTOCOL FOR SOUTH AMERICAN SEA
      LIONS (OTARIA FLAVESCENS).
PG  - 956-965
LID - 10.1638/2020-0204 [doi]
AB  - Accelerated healing in wild or captive South American sea lions (Otaria
      flavescens) is a key tool to help minimize infection and complications associated
      with open wounds, dental disease, and ocular pathology. Platelet-rich plasma
      (PRP) is an autogenous source for growth factors based on platelet concentration,
      which can be obtained by centrifuging whole blood collected in sodium citrate
      anticoagulant. Currently, there are well-defined PRP concentration protocols for 
      humans and most domestic companion animal species. However, there is no clear
      centrifugation protocol for obtaining PRP in most marine mammal species. This
      study aimed to optimize the platelet concentration protocol based on whole blood 
      centrifugation using speeds ranging from 500 to 5,000 rpm and times ranging from 
      3 to 6 min. Blood was drawn from seven adult South American sea lions, placed
      into 1-ml sodium citrate tubes, and centrifuged following 12 different
      centrifugation protocols. PRP was designated as the lower third fraction of the
      centrifuged plasma. Platelet counts were performed using flow cytometry and
      statistical analysis was carried out to establish a well-defined protocol for
      efficient PRP production. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis was
      performed to evaluate possible platelet degranulation during the different
      centrifugation protocols and measure platelet areas. Maximum concentration of
      platelets in PRP was 4.73-fold higher than the number of platelets in equal
      volume of whole blood, and significant differences in the concentrations obtained
      were found between the 12 centrifugation protocols evaluated using different
      speed and time combinations. The best one-step centrifugation protocol resulted
      from using 900-rpm speed for 3 min. The highest-fold increase was achieved using 
      a two-step centrifugation protocol, which combined the most efficient one-step
      centrifugation protocol (900 rpm, 3 min) with a second centrifugation using
      2,000-rpm speed for 6 min. TEM analysis confirmed that platelets were complete
      and maintained integrity after the proposed protocol.

TI  - OPTIMIZATION OF FECAL FLOTATIONS IN MARINE PARASITOLOGY AND DETERMINATION OF THE 
      SPECIFIC GRAVITY OF HELMINTH EGGS IN PINNIPEDS.
PG  - 949-955
LID - 10.1638/2020-0155 [doi]
AB  - Recent studies have sought to optimize the fecal flotation procedure to improve
      the detection of helminth eggs in terrestrial domestic species. It is unclear,
      however, whether these efforts in optimization are applicable to parasite species
      of marine environments, and verification of veterinary diagnostic procedures is
      clinically important. It was hypothesized that the eggs belonging to the
      parasites of pinnipeds would have different specific gravities (SpG) than those
      belonging to terrestrial hosts. Fecal samples were collected from each of 25
      stranded pinnipeds representing three species (Zalophus californianus, Phoca
      vitulina, Mirounga angustirostris), and modified double centrifugal flotations
      were performed on 1-g samples. Among the 22 California sea lions sampled,
      trematode, ascarid, and cestode eggs were detected in 17/22 (77%), 10/22 (45%),
      and 4/22 (18%) individuals, respectively. Sugar-gradient modified centrifugation 
      flotations were then conducted on a subset of 10 samples from California sea
      lions to evaluate the distribution of eggs in fractions representing varying SpG.
      Higher numbers of ascarid eggs were found in fractions representing a lower SpG
      (1.00-1.15), whereas trematode eggs belonging to the genus Zalophotrema were
      found in significantly higher numbers in the fraction representing 1.25 (P <
      0.05). In conclusion, the SpG of trematode, ascarid, and cestode eggs from
      pinnipeds appears to be similar to those from terrestrial hosts, but numerous
      factors may affect their ability to be detected using traditional diagnostic
      approaches. Further exploration into the nature of the variability noted may lead
      to improved diagnostics in marine parasitology.

TI  - A RETROSPECTIVE STUDY OF BRAIN LESIONS IN CAPTIVE NONDOMESTIC FELIDS.
PG  - 918-925
LID - 10.1638/2021-0016 [doi]
AB  - This retrospective study identified and characterized brain lesions in captive
      nondomestic felids from a large cat sanctuary. Necropsy reports from January 2002
      through December 2018 were examined, and gross images and microscopic slides were
      reviewed from individual cats, where available. In total, 255 cats met the
      following inclusion criteria: complete necropsy report available, brain examined 
      grossly or microscopically, and age of >1 mon. Of the 255 cats, 49 cats (19%)
      were determined to have brain lesions. Eleven different felid species, as well as
      one captive-bred hybrid (liger), were included in the study, with tigers
      (Panthera tigris) (55%) and lions (Panthera leo) (18%) being the most common
      species. Lesions were grouped into six etiologic categories: neoplastic (32%),
      vascular (26%), inflammatory or infectious (20%), congenital (9%), idiopathic
      (7%), and metabolic (6%). Not included in these categorized lesions were
      previously undescribed amphophilic globules in the cerebral cortex of many cats
      with and without other brain lesions; these were in 95% of lion and 93% of tiger 
      brains where the cerebral cortex was available for histologic examination. These 
      globules were not associated with clinical disease. The histopathologic and gross
      brain changes documented in this study provide insight into specific diseases and
      pathologic processes that affect the brains of captive large cat populations.

TI  - PHARMACOKINETICS OF SUBCUTANEOUS ALPHA LIPOIC ACID, A PROPOSED THERAPEUTIC AID
      FOR DOMOIC ACID INTOXICATION IN CALIFORNIA SEA LIONS (ZALOPHUS CALIFORNIANUS).
PG  - 872-879
LID - 10.1638/2020-0223 [doi]
AB  - Domoic acid (DA) is a potent neurotoxin produced by certain marine algae that can
      cause neurologic and cardiac dysfunction by activating glutamate receptors.
      Glutamate receptor overexcitation results in continuous cellular activation,
      oxidative damage, and cell death. DA toxicosis causes disorientation and
      seizures, and antiseizure medications are the primary treatment. Alpha lipoic
      acid (ALA), a powerful antioxidant and glutathione precursor widely used in
      humans and dogs, can cross the blood-brain barrier to provide antioxidant
      availability to brain tissue. Hundreds of stranded California sea lions (CSL;
      Zalophus californianus) are diagnosed annually with DA toxicosis and thus are an 
      appropriate animal in which to establish ALA dosing recommendations for
      treatment. The objective of this study was to determine the population
      pharmacokinetics of a single 10- or 20-mg/kg dose of ALA administered
      subcutaneously into the interscapular region to healthy rehabilitated CSL. Blood 
      was collected at two time points between 15 min and 24 h after administration.
      Serum ALA concentrations were measured by liquid chromatography-mass
      spectrometry, and parameters were evaluated using a nonlinear mixed effects
      model. ALA was rapidly absorbed for each dose, peaking within 20 to 30 minutes,
      and t1/2 of 40 and 32 min (10 and 20 mg/kg, respectively), followed by an initial
      steep distribution phase and prolonged elimination phase. Peak concentration
      (CMAX) was 1,243 ng/ml (10-mg/ml dose) and 5,010 ng/ml (20-mg/ml dose). Serum
      from 13 CSLd with DA toxicosis treated with 10 mg/kg ALA for 1 to 9 d had
      measurable levels, and ALA was also measurable in cerebrospinal fluid from two
      treated CSLs. Therapeutic effects are noted with a CMAX of 4,000 to 5,000 ng/ml
      in humans; thus in CSLs, 20 mg/kg administered subcutaneously once daily may be
      sufficient to achieve a therapeutic level in this species. Determination of
      efficacy and optimal dosing interval and duration require additional
      investigation.

TI  - REPRISAL: mapping lignification dynamics using chemistry, data segmentation, and 
      ratiometric analysis.
PG  - 816-830
LID - 10.1093/plphys/kiab490 [doi]
AB  - This article describes a methodology for detailed mapping of the lignification
      capacity of plant cell walls that we have called "REPRISAL" for REPorter
      Ratiometrics Integrating Segmentation for Analyzing Lignification. REPRISAL
      consists of the combination of three separate approaches. In the first approach, 
      H*, G*, and S* monolignol chemical reporters, corresponding to p-coumaryl
      alcohol, coniferyl alcohol, and sinapyl alcohol, are used to label the growing
      lignin polymer in a fluorescent triple labeling strategy based on the sequential 
      use of three main bioorthogonal chemical reactions. In the second step, an
      automatic parametric and/or artificial intelligence segmentation algorithm is
      developed that assigns fluorescent image pixels to three distinct cell wall zones
      corresponding to cell corners, compound middle lamella and secondary cell walls. 
      The last step corresponds to the exploitation of a ratiometric approach enabling 
      statistical analyses of differences in monolignol reporter distribution
      (ratiometric method [RM] 1) and proportions (RM 2) within the different cell wall
      zones. We first describe the use of this methodology to map developmentally
      related changes in the lignification capacity of wild-type Arabidopsis
      (Arabidopsis thaliana) interfascicular fiber cells. We then apply REPRISAL to
      analyze the Arabidopsis peroxidase (PRX) mutant prx64 and provide further
      evidence for the implication of the AtPRX64 protein in floral stem lignification.
      In addition, we also demonstrate the general applicability of REPRISAL by using
      it to map lignification capacity in poplar (Populus tremula x Populus alba), flax
      (Linum usitatissimum), and maize (Zea mays). Finally, we show that the
      methodology can be used to map the incorporation of a fucose reporter into
      noncellulosic cell wall polymers.

TI  - Customisable Tablet Printing: The Development of Multimaterial Hot Melt Inkjet 3D
      Printing to Produce Complex and Personalised Dosage Forms.
LID - 1679 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics13101679 [doi]
AB  - One of the most striking characteristics of 3D printing is its capability to
      produce multi-material objects with complex geometry. In pharmaceutics this
      translates to the possibility of dosage forms with multi-drug loading, tailored
      dosing and release. We have developed a novel dual material hot-melt inkjet 3D
      printing system which allows for precisely controlled multi-material solvent free
      inkjet printing. This reduces the need for time-consuming exchanges of printable 
      inks and expensive post processing steps. With this printer, we show the
      potential for design of printed dosage forms for tailored drug release, including
      single and multi-material complex 3D patterns with defined localised drug loading
      where a drug-free ink is used as a release-retarding barrier. For this, we used
      Compritol HD5 ATO (matrix material) and Fenofibrate (model drug) to prepare both 
      drug-free and drug-loaded inks with drug concentrations varying between 5% and
      30% (w/w). The printed constructs demonstrated the required physical properties
      and displayed immediate, extended, delayed and pulsatile drug release depending
      on drug localisation inside of the printed formulations. For the first time, this
      paper demonstrates that a commonly used pharmaceutical lipid, Compritol HD5 ATO, 
      can be printed via hot-melt inkjet printing as single ink material, or in
      combination with a drug, without the need for additional solvents. Concurrently, 
      this paper demonstrates the capabilities of dual material hot-melt inkjet 3D
      printing system to produce multi-material personalised solid dosage forms.

TI  - Determinants of Disease Penetrance in PRPF31-Associated Retinopathy.
LID - 1542 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/genes12101542 [doi]
AB  - Retinitis pigmentosa 11 (RP11) is caused by dominant mutations in PRPF31, however
      a significant proportion of mutation carriers do not develop retinopathy. Here,
      we investigated the relationship between CNOT3 polymorphism, MSR1 repeat copy
      number and disease penetrance in RP11 patients and non-penetrant carriers (NPCs).
      We further characterized PRPF31 and CNOT3 expression in fibroblasts from eight
      RP11 patients and one NPC from a family carrying the c.1205C>T variant. Retinal
      organoids (ROs) and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) were differentiated from
      induced pluripotent stem cells derived from RP11 patients, an NPC and a control
      subject. All RP11 patients were homozygous for the 3-copy MSR1 repeat in the
      PRPF31 promoter, while 3/5 NPCs carried a 4-copy MSR1 repeat. The CNOT3 rs4806718
      genotype did not correlate with disease penetrance. PRFP31 expression declined
      with age in adult cadaveric retina. PRPF31 and CNOT3 expression was reduced in
      RP11 fibroblasts, RO and RPE compared with controls. Both RP11 and NPC RPE
      displayed shortened primary cilia compared with controls, however a subpopulation
      of cells with normal cilia lengths was present in NPC RPE monolayers. Our results
      indicate that RP11 non-penetrance is associated with the inheritance of a 4-copy 
      MSR1 repeat, but not with CNOT3 polymorphisms.

TI  - Preoperative CT or PET/CT to Assess Pelvic and Para-Aortic Lymph Node Status in
      Epithelial Ovarian Cancer? A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 1748 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics11101748 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In advanced epithelial ovarian cancer (EOC), the LION trial
      restricted lymphadenectomy indication to patients with suspect lymph nodes before
      and during surgery. Preoperative imaging is used to assess lymph node status, and
      particularly CT and PET/CT. The aim of this systematic review and meta-analysis
      was to evaluate the diagnostic accuracy of preoperative CT and PET/CT to detect
      lymph node metastasis (LNM) in patients with EOC; Methods: Databases were
      searched from January 1990 to May 2019 for studies that evaluated the diagnostic 
      accuracy of preoperative CT and PET/CT to detect LNM in patients with EOC with
      histology as the gold standard. Pooled diagnostic accuracy was calculated using
      bivariate random-effects models and hierarchical summary receiver operating curve
      (HSROC). This study is registered with PROSPERO number CRD42020179214; Results: A
      total of five studies were included in the meta-analysis: four articles concerned
      preoperative CT and four articles concerned preoperative PET/CT, involving 106
      and 138 patients, respectively. For preoperative CT, pooled sensitivity was 0.47 
      95% CI [0.20-0.76], pooled specificity was 0.99 95% CI [0.75-1.00] and area under
      the curve (AUC) of the HSROC was 0.91 95% CI [0.88-0.93]. For preoperative
      PET/CT, pooled sensitivity was 0.81 95% CI [0.61-0.92], pooled specificity was
      0.96 95% CI [0.91-0.99] and AUC of the HSROC was 0.97 95% CI [0.95-0.98];
      Conclusions: PET/CT has a very high diagnostic accuracy, especially for
      specificity, to detect LNM in EOC and should be realized systematically,
      additionally to CT recommended to evaluate peritoneal spread, in the preoperative
      staging of patients with an advanced disease.

TI  - A phase II randomised study of preoperative trastuzumab alone or combined with
      everolimus in patients with early HER2-positive breast cancer and predictive
      biomarkers (RADHER trial).

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Resistance to trastuzumab in breast cancer is an ongoing challenge.
      Clinical and biological effects of co-targeting HER2 and mammalian target of
      rapamycin (mTOR) in patients with HER2-positive early operable breast cancer via 
      the addition of everolimus to preoperative trastuzumab were evaluated in a phase 
      II randomised study. METHODS: Patients were randomised 1:1 to receive trastuzumab
      (4 mg/kg initial dose then 2 mg/kg weekly for 5 weeks) alone or combined with
      everolimus (10 mg/day for 6 weeks) and then underwent surgery. Tumours were
      assessed by clinical examination and echography at the baseline and on treatment.
      The primary end-point was the clinical response rate at 6 weeks. Pathological
      response and safety were also evaluated. Baseline and surgery tumour samples were
      assessed by immunohistochemistry and multiplex immunoanalysis for predictive
      downstream effectors of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR and MAP kinase (MAPK) pathways.
      RESULTS: Eighty-two patients were enrolled, 41 per arm. The clinical response
      rates were 34.1% and 43.9% with trastuzumab alone and combined with everolimus,
      respectively. Pathological response rates were 43.6% and 47.5%, respectively.
      Addition of everolimus increased toxicity, notably mucositis (82.5% versus 5.0%) 
      and rash (57.5% versus 10.0%), but grade III/IV events were rare. No correlation 
      between response to treatments and baseline candidate biomarkers was identified, 
      except for PIK3CA mutations which were found to predict trastuzumab resistance.
      Significant changes were seen in several MAPK pathway effectors after combination
      therapy. CONCLUSIONS: The addition of everolimus did not improve the efficacy,
      but induced MAPK signalling. Combination therapy to overcome pathway cross-talk
      should be considered to maximise the effectiveness of trastuzumab in this
      setting. ClinicalTrial.gov Identifier NCT00674414.

TI  - Associations of 12-year sleep behaviour trajectories from childhood to
      adolescence with myopia and ocular biometry during young adulthood.
PG  - 19-27
LID - 10.1111/opo.12905 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Cross-sectional studies have variably reported that poor sleep quality
      may be associated with myopia in children. Longitudinal data, collected over the 
      ages when myopia develops and progresses, could provide new insights into the
      sleep-myopia paradigm. This study tested the hypothesis that 12-year trajectories
      of sleep behaviour from childhood to adolescence is associated with myopia during
      young adulthood. METHODS: At the 5-, 8-, 10-, 14- and 17-year follow-ups of the
      longitudinal Raine Study, which has been following a cohort since their birth in 
      1989-1992, participants' parents/guardians completed the Child Behaviour
      Checklist questionnaire (CBCL), which collected information on their child's
      sleep behaviour and quality. The CBCL includes six questions measuring sleep
      behaviour, which parents rated as 0 = not true, 1 = somewhat/sometimes true, or 2
      = very/often true. Scores were summed at each follow-up to form a composite
      "sleep behaviour score". Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) was used to classify
      participants according to their 12-year trajectory of sleep behaviour. At the
      20-year follow-up, an eye examination was performed which included cycloplegic
      autorefraction and axial length measurement. RESULTS: The LCGA identified three
      clusters of participants based on their trajectory of sleep behaviour: those with
      minimal' (43.6% of the total Raine Study sample), 'declining' (48.9%), or
      'persistent' (7.5%) sleep problems. A total of 1194 participants had ophthalmic
      data and longitudinal sleep data available for analysis (47.2% female, 85.6%
      Caucasian). No significant differences were observed in regards to age, sex,
      ethnicity or ocular parameters between trajectory groups. Unadjusted and fully
      adjusted analyses demonstrated that sleep problem behaviour was not significantly
      associated with changes in refractive error, axial length or corneal radius.
      CONCLUSIONS: Our findings do not support the hypothesis that there is an
      association between sleep behaviour and myopia. Future longitudinal studies
      should explore sleep trajectory data pre- and post-myopia diagnosis to confirm
      our results.

TI  - Do Corneal Tissue Providers Inform Their Community That They Export Corneas? An
      Audit of Publicly Available Sector Websites.
PG  - 4029-4034
LID - 10.2147/OPTH.S330468 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The exportation of corneas from one nation to another, for transplantation
      services, is responsible for 23% of all global transplants. Global allocation is 
      possible because of the end-of-life donations from citizens and residents of
      export nations. To date, there is no information indicating if export nation
      donors are aware that their corneas may be exported, nor if organizations that
      export provide information regarding their export engagement to their community. 
      To ascertain if and how exporters inform their community, we audited known export
      organization public websites. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We designed and conducted a 
      double-blind audit of known exporting eye banks, eye tissue sharing and
      distributor organization websites. RESULTS: We audited 79 websites, from 9
      nations. Of the 79, 46 (58.2%) did not mention corneal tissue exportation, 17
      (21.5%) implied exportation, and 16 (10.2%) explicitly mentioned it. Of the 16
      that mentioned they exported, 75% (12/16) provided information regarding their
      export license, and 12.5% (2/16) indicated partnership with a third party. We
      could not locate information explaining how organizations decided on how and to
      whom they export. DISCUSSION: Organizations that export corneal tissue across
      national borders do not share sufficient information regarding their export
      activities on their website. The general public and donors within export nations 
      may not be aware that this practice occurs or could occur with their donation.
      Export organizations and the eye tissue sector must evaluate their communication 
      strategies and collaborate, preferably nationally, to develop publicly
      appropriate information regarding corneal tissue exportation.

AB  - We conducted an updated epidemiological study of Leber hereditary optic
      neuropathy (LHON) in Australia by using registry data to establish the risk of
      vision loss among different LHON mutations, sex, age at onset, and mitochondrial 
      haplogroup. We identified 96 genetically unrelated LHON pedigrees, including 56
      unpublished pedigrees, and updated 40 previously known pedigrees, comprising 620 
      affected individuals and 4,948 asymptomatic carriers. The minimum prevalence of
      vision loss due to LHON in Australia in 2020 was one in 68,403 individuals.
      Although our data confirm some well-established features of LHON, the overall
      risk of vision loss among those with a LHON mutation was lower than reported
      previously-17.5% for males and 5.4% for females. Our findings confirm that women,
      older adults, and younger children are also at risk. Furthermore, we observed a
      higher incidence of vision loss in children of affected mothers as well as in
      children of unaffected women with at least one affected brother. Finally, we
      confirmed our previous report showing a generational fall in prevalence of vision
      loss among Australian men. Higher reported rates of vision loss in males with a
      LHON mutation are not supported by our work and other epidemiologic studies.
      Accurate knowledge of risk is essential for genetic counseling of individuals
      with LHON mutations. This knowledge could also inform the detection and
      validation of potential biomarkers and has implications for clinical trials of
      treatments aimed at preventing vision loss in LHON because an overestimated risk 
      may lead to an underpowered study or a false claim of efficacy.

PG  - e00308
LID - 10.1002/edm2.308 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Diabetic macular oedema (DME) is one of the major cause of
      decreased visual acuity in patients with diabetic retinopathy. Poor glycaemic
      control is associated with increased incidence of DME. METHODS: A total of 112
      eyes of 112 patients were studied in this cross-sectional study and were
      classified into three groups based on HbA1c: group 1 included patients with good 
      glycaemic control (HbA1c </=7%), group 2 included patients with moderate
      glycaemic control (HbA1c between 7% and 9%) and group 3 included patients with
      poor glycaemic control (HbA1c >/=9%). RESULTS: We included 112 eyes of 112
      patients. The mean duration of diabetes mellitus (DM) was 11.37 years. In
      statistical analysis, CMT (mean 188.80 +/- 27.64 mum) positively correlated with 
      mean HbA1c level (7.95 +/- 1.29%) (r = 0.238, p < .05). There was a significant
      difference in CMT values among the three groups of HbA1c (F (2,109) = 19.39, p < 
      .001). Post hoc analysis showed statistical significance between HbA1c</=7% and
      HbA1c >/=9% group and HbA1c 7%-9% and >/=9% group. However, statistical
      significance was not found among HbA1c </=7% group and HbA1c 7%-9% group.
      Multiple regression analyses showed a significant correlation between CMT and
      HbA1c after adjusting for age and duration of diabetes. CONCLUSION: Serum HbA1c
      level has a significant correlation with CMT in diabetic patients.

TI  - Temporal scale of habitat selection for large carnivores: Balancing energetics,
      risk and finding prey.
PG  - 182-195
LID - 10.1111/1365-2656.13613 [doi]
AB  - When navigating heterogeneous landscapes, large carnivores must balance
      trade-offs between multiple goals, including minimizing energetic expenditure,
      maintaining access to hunting opportunities and avoiding potential risk from
      humans. The relative importance of these goals in driving carnivore movement
      likely changes across temporal scales, but our understanding of these dynamics
      remains limited. Here we quantified how drivers of movement and habitat selection
      changed with temporal grain for two large carnivore species living in
      human-dominated landscapes, providing insights into commonalities in carnivore
      movement strategies across regions. We used high-resolution GPS collar data and
      integrated step selection analyses to model movement and habitat selection for
      African lions Panthera leo in Laikipia, Kenya and pumas Puma concolor in the
      Santa Cruz Mountains of California across eight temporal grains, ranging from 5
      min to 12 hr. Analyses considered landscape covariates that are related to
      energetics, resource acquisition and anthropogenic risk. For both species,
      topographic slope, which strongly influences energetic expenditure, drove habitat
      selection and movement patterns over fine temporal grains but was less important 
      at longer temporal grains. In contrast, avoiding anthropogenic risk during the
      day, when risk was highest, was consistently important across grains, but the
      degree to which carnivores relaxed this avoidance at night was strongest for
      longer term movements. Lions and pumas modified their movement behaviour
      differently in response to anthropogenic features: lions sped up while near
      humans at fine temporal grains, while pumas slowed down in more developed areas
      at coarse temporal grains. Finally, pumas experienced a trade-off between
      energetically efficient movement and avoiding anthropogenic risk. Temporal grain 
      is an important methodological consideration in habitat selection analyses, as
      drivers of both movement and habitat selection changed across temporal grain.
      Additionally, grain-dependent patterns can reflect meaningful behavioural
      processes, including how fitness-relevant goals influence behaviour over
      different periods of time. In applying multi-scale analysis to fine-resolution
      data, we showed that two large carnivore species in very different
      human-dominated landscapes balanced competing energetic and safety demands in
      largely similar ways. These commonalities suggest general strategies of landscape
      use across large carnivore species.

LID - 10.1111/hiv.13168 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Our aim was to assess if switching from a protease inhibitors
      (PI)-based regimen to a PI-free one is associated with an increased risk of
      Kaposi Sarcoma (KS) relapse among patients living with HIV (PLHIV) with history
      of KS and controlled HIV replication. METHODS: In a retrospective analysis of the
      prospectively collected Dat'AIDS database we selected patients who both had a
      past KS history and a HIV-1 viral load below 200 copies/mL while being
      PI-treated. We searched for KS relapses while persistent virological success was 
      maintained for at least 6 months, whether patients kept taking the PI, or
      switched to PI-free regimen. RESULTS: Among the 216 patients with past KS event
      and a history of HIV-1 infection efficiently treated by a PI-based regimen, 148
      patients (68.5%) later switched to a PI-sparing regimen. Their baseline
      characteristics were not different from non-switching patients. We described 7
      cases of relapse (3.2% of the 216 patients). Five cases of relapse occurred in
      switching patients (3.4%). The remaining two relapses occurred in PI-treated
      patients (2.9%). At KS relapse, CD4 cell count was 459 cells/muL (range 225-560) 
      for switching patients, compared with 362 and 136 cells/muL for the other two
      patients. CONCLUSIONS: In this large cohort of PLHIV with a history of KS and
      ART-controlled HIV replication, KS relapses were described in 3.2% of the
      patients, and were not more frequent when a PI-containing ART regimen has been
      switched to a PI-free regimen. Our results do not support a specific effect of PI
      on KS.

AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the alteration in lipid composition of meibum, objective 
      clinical signs, and subjective symptoms associated with aging and meibomian gland
      (MG) dysfunction (MGD). METHODS: In 10 MGD patients [4 males/6 females, mean age:
      65.6 +/- 7.9 years (range: 50-79 years)] and 24 healthy volunteer subjects [young
      subjects: 6 males/6 females, mean age: 25.7 +/- 3.8 years (range: 20-35 years),
      elderly subjects: 6 males/6 females, mean age: 58.4 +/- 7.5 years (range: 50-79
      years)], three objective clinical signs were evaluated: MG orifice obstruction,
      meibum score, and tear film lipid layer interference pattern. Subjective symptoms
      were analyzed via a 15-item questionnaire. After careful collection of meibum
      samples, comprehensive lipid analysis was performed via liquid
      chromatography-mass spectrometry. Data was analyzed via JMP(R) ver. 13 (SAS
      Institute, Inc., Cary, NC) statistical analysis software. RESULTS: In the MGD
      patients and elderly subjects, there was a significant decrease in non-polar
      lipids such as cholesterol esters (ChEs), while a significant increase in polar
      lipids [cholesterol (Ch), (O-acyl)-omega-hydroxy fatty acid (OAHFA), and free
      fatty acid (FA)] in total lipids (Tukey-Kramer test: p < 0.05). Triglyceride was 
      significantly increased only in MGD patients (p < 0.05). Symptom scores
      representative of vision quality (i.e., blurred vision/haziness) were
      significantly negatively-correlated with the ratio of the non-polar lipid ChE,
      while significantly positively correlated with the polar lipids Ch, OAHFA, and FA
      (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient: p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings
      revealed that both MGD and aging affect the composition ratio of major meibum
      lipids, resulting in the appearance of subjective symptoms.

AB  - PURPOSE: To determine whether age-related macular degeneration (AMD) severity or 
      the frequency of retinal pigment epithelium mitochondrial DNA lesions differ in
      human donor eyes that have undergone cataract surgery compared to phakic eyes.
      METHODS: Eyes from human donors aged >/= 55 years were obtained from the
      Minnesota Lions Eye Bank. Cataract surgery status was obtained from history
      provided to Eye Bank personnel by family members at the time of tissue
      procurement. Donor eyes were graded for AMD severity using the Minnesota Grading 
      System. Quantitative PCR was performed on DNA isolated from macular punches of
      retinal pigment epithelium to quantitate the frequency of mitochondrial DNA
      lesions in the donor tissue. Univariable and multivariable analyses were
      performed to evaluate for associations between (1) cataract surgery and AMD
      severity and (2) cataract surgery and mitochondrial DNA lesion frequency.
      RESULTS: A total of 157 subjects qualified for study inclusion. Multivariable
      analysis with age, sex, smoking status, and cataract surgery status showed that
      only age was associated with AMD grade. Multivariable analysis with age, sex,
      smoking status, and cataract surgery status showed that none of these factors
      were associated with retinal pigment epithelium mitochondrial DNA lesion
      frequency. CONCLUSIONS: In this study of human donor eyes, neither retinal
      pigment epithelium mitochondrial DNA damage nor the stage of AMD severity are
      independently associated with cataract surgery after adjusting for other AMD risk
      factors. These new pathologic and molecular findings provide evidence against a
      relationship between cataract surgery and AMD progression and support the idea
      that cataract surgery is safe in the setting of AMD.

TI  - Modeling and control of epidemics through testing policies.
PG  - 554-572
LID - 10.1016/j.arcontrol.2021.09.004 [doi]
AB  - Testing is a crucial control mechanism in the beginning phase of an epidemic when
      the vaccines are not yet available. It enables the public health authority to
      detect and isolate the infected cases from the population, thereby limiting the
      disease transmission to susceptible people. However, despite the significance of 
      testing in epidemic control, the recent literature on the subject lacks a
      control-theoretic perspective. In this paper, an epidemic model is proposed that 
      incorporates the testing rate as a control input and differentiates the
      undetected infected from the detected infected cases, who are assumed to be
      removed from the disease spreading process in the population. After estimating
      the model on the data corresponding to the beginning phase of COVID-19 in France,
      two testing policies are proposed: the so-called best-effort strategy for testing
      (BEST) and constant optimal strategy for testing (COST). The BEST policy is a
      suppression strategy that provides a minimum testing rate that stops the growth
      of the epidemic when implemented. The COST policy, on the other hand, is a
      mitigation strategy that provides an optimal value of testing rate minimizing the
      peak value of the infected population when the total stockpile of tests is
      limited. Both testing policies are evaluated by their impact on the number of
      active intensive care unit (ICU) cases and the cumulative number of deaths for
      the COVID-19 case of France.

      Ulleungdo, South Korea.

AB  - The Japanese sea lion, Zalophus japonicus, is an extinct pinniped species, which 
      had inhabited along the coast of the Japanese archipelago and Korean peninsula.
      Its mitochondrial genome was determined by the assembly of PCR amplicons from the
      skeletal remains excavated from the Ulleungdo, South Korea. The whole mitogenome 
      was 16,698 bp in length, which encoded 13 protein-coding genes (PCGs), 22
      transfer RNAs (tRNA), 2 ribosomal RNAs (rRNA), an origin of light-strand
      replication (OL), and a control region (D-loop). Unusual start codons were
      identified in ND2 (ATA), ND3 (ATA), and ND5 (ATC), while COIII, ND3, and ND4 were
      terminated with an incomplete stop codon (T-/TA-). Phylogenetic analysis showed
      that Z. japonicus was a sister species to Z. californianus with 98.61% nucleotide
      sequence identity among 11 pinniped species in the infraorder Pinnipedia, which
      supported the previous results. The complete mitochondrial genome sequence of Z. 
      japonicus would be valuable information for its restoration and the evolutional
      understandings of pinniped species in the Pacific Ocean.

TI  - Asciminib and ponatinib exert synergistic anti-neoplastic effects on CML cells
      expressing BCR-ABL1 (T315I)-compound mutations.
PG  - 4470-4484
AB  - Ponatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) directed against BCR-ABL1 which is
      successfully used in patients with BCR-ABL1 (T315I)+ chronic myeloid leukemia
      (CML). However, BCR-ABL1 compound mutations may develop during therapy in these
      patients and may lead to drug resistance. Asciminib is a novel drug capable of
      targeting most BCR-ABL1 mutant-forms, including BCR-ABL1(T315I), but remains
      ineffective against most BCR-ABL1(T315I)+ compound mutation-bearing sub-clones.
      We demonstrate that asciminib synergizes with ponatinib in inducing growth-arrest
      and apoptosis in patient-derived CML cell lines and murine Ba/F3 cells harboring 
      BCR-ABL1 (T315I) or T315I-including compound mutations. Asciminib and ponatinib
      also produced cooperative effects on CRKL phosphorylation in BCR-ABL1-transformed
      cells. The growth-inhibitory effects of the drug combination
      'asciminib+ponatinib' was further enhanced by hydroxyurea (HU), a drug which has 
      lately been described to suppresses the proliferation of BCR-ABL1 (T315I)+ CML
      cells. Cooperative drug effects were also observed in patient-derived CML cells. 
      Most importantly, we were able to show that the combinations
      'asciminib+ponatinib' and 'asciminib+ponatinib+HU' produce synergistic
      apoptosis-inducing effects in CD34(+)/CD38(-) CML stem cells obtained from
      patients with chronic phase CML or BCR-ABL1 (T315I)+ CML blast phase. Together,
      asciminib, ponatinib and HU synergize in producing anti-leukemic effects in
      multi-resistant CML cells, including cells harboring T315I+ BCR-ABL1 compound
      mutations and CML stem cells. The clinical efficacy of this TKI combination needs
      to be evaluated within the frame of upcoming clinical trials.

TI  - Dolutegravir-based dual maintenance regimens combined with
      lamivudine/emtricitabine or rilpivirine: risk of virological failure in a
      real-life setting.
PG  - 196-204

AB  - BACKGROUND: Maintenance ART with dolutegravir-based dual regimens have proved
      their efficacy among HIV-1-infected subjects in randomized trials. However,
      real-life data are scarce, with limited populations and follow-up. OBJECTIVES: We
      assessed virological failure (VF) and resistance-associated mutations (RAMs) on
      dolutegravir maintenance regimens in combination with rilpivirine or with
      lamivudine or emtricitabine (xTC) and analysed the factors associated with VF.
      METHODS: Between 2014 and 2018, all HIV-1-infected adults included in the
      Dat'AIDS cohort and starting dolutegravir/rilpivirine or dolutegravir/xTC as a
      maintenance dolutegravir-based dual regimen were selected. VF was defined as two 
      consecutive HIV RNA values >50 copies/mL or a single value >400 copies/mL. We
      compared cumulative genotypes before initiation of a maintenance
      dolutegravir-based dual regimen with genotype at VF. RESULTS: We analysed 1374
      subjects (799 on dolutegravir/rilpivirine and 575 on dolutegravir/xTC) with a
      median follow-up of 20 months (IQR = 11-31) and 19 months (IQR = 11-31),
      respectively. VF occurred in 3.8% (n = 30) of dolutegravir/rilpivirine subjects
      and 2.6% (n = 15) of dolutegravir/xTC subjects. Among subjects receiving
      dolutegravir/rilpivirine, two genotypes harboured emerging RAMs at VF: E138K on
      NNRTI (n = 1); and E138K+K101E on NNRTI and N155H on INSTI (n = 1). Among
      subjects receiving dolutegravir/xTC, no new RAM was detected. The only predictive
      factor of VF on dolutegravir/rilpivirine was the history of failure on an
      NNRTI-based regimen (adjusted HR = 2.97, 95% CI = 1.28-6.93). No factor was
      associated with VF on dolutegravir/xTC. CONCLUSIONS: In this large real-life
      cohort, dolutegravir/rilpivirine and dolutegravir/xTC sustained virological
      suppression and were associated with a low rate of VF and RAM emergence. Careful 
      virological screening is essential before switching to dolutegravir/rilpivirine
      in virologically suppressed patients with a history of NNRTI therapy.

TI  - A new optimization algorithm to solve multi-objective problems.
PG  - 20326
LID - 10.1038/s41598-021-99617-x [doi]
AB  - Simultaneous optimization of several competing objectives requires increasing the
      capability of optimization algorithms. This paper proposes the multi-objective
      moth swarm algorithm, for the first time, to solve various multi-objective
      problems. In the proposed algorithm, a new definition for pathfinder moths and
      moonlight was proposed to enhance the synchronization capability as well as to
      maintain a good spread of non-dominated solutions. In addition, the
      crowding-distance mechanism was employed to select the most efficient solutions
      within the population. This mechanism indicates the distribution of non-dominated
      solutions around a particular non-dominated solution. Accordingly, a set of
      non-dominated solutions obtained by the proposed multi-objective algorithm is
      kept in an archive to be used later for improving its exploratory capability. The
      capability of the proposed MOMSA was investigated by a set of multi-objective
      benchmark problems having 7 to 30 dimensions. The results were compared with
      three well-known meta-heuristics of multi-objective evolutionary algorithm based 
      on decomposition (MOEA/D), Pareto envelope-based selection algorithm II
      (PESA-II), and multi-objective ant lion optimizer (MOALO). Four metrics of
      generational distance (GD), spacing (S), spread (Delta), and maximum spread (MS) 
      were employed for comparison purposes. The qualitative and quantitative results
      indicated the superior performance and the higher capability of the proposed
      MOMSA algorithm over the other algorithms. The MOMSA algorithm with the average
      values of CPU time = 2771 s, GD = 0.138, S = 0.063, Delta = 1.053, and MS = 0.878
      proved to be a robust and reliable model for multi-objective optimization.

TI  - Tuberculosis-Learning the Impact of Nutrition (TB LION): protocol for an
      interventional study to decrease TB risk in household contacts.
PG  - 1058
LID - 10.1186/s12879-021-06734-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Comorbidities such as undernutrition and parasitic infections are
      widespread in India and other tuberculosis (TB)-endemic countries. This study
      examines how these conditions as well as food supplementation and parasite
      treatment might alter immune responses to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb)
      infection and risk of progression to TB disease. METHODS: This is a 5-year
      prospective clinical trial at Jawaharlal Institute of Post Graduate Medical
      Education and Research in Puducherry, Tamil Nadu, India. We aim to enroll 760
      household contacts (HHC) of adults with active TB in order to identify 120 who
      are followed prospectively for 2 years: Thirty QuantiFERON-TB Gold Plus
      (QFT-Plus) positive HHCs >/= 18 years of age in four proposed groups: (1)
      undernourished (body mass index [BMI] < 18.5 kg/m(2)); (2) participants with a
      BMI >/= 18.5 kg/m(2) who have a parasitic infection (3) undernourished
      participants with a parasitic infection and (4) controls-participants with BMI
      >/= 18.5 kg/m(2) and without parasitic infection. We assess immune response at
      baseline and after food supplementation (for participants with BMI < 18.5
      kg/m(2)) and parasite treatment (for participants with parasites). Detailed
      nutritional assessments, anthropometry, and parasite testing through polymerase
      chain reaction (PCR) and microscopy are performed. In addition, at serial time
      points, these samples will be further analyzed using flow cytometry and whole
      blood transcriptomics to elucidate the immune mechanisms involved in disease
      progression. CONCLUSIONS: This study will help determine whether undernutrition
      and parasite infection are associated with gene signatures that predict risk of
      TB and whether providing nutritional supplementation and/or treating parasitic
      infections improves immune response towards this infection. This study transcends
      individual level care and presents the opportunity to benefit the population at
      large by analyzing factors that affect disease progression potentially reducing
      the overall burden of people who progress to TB disease. Trial registration

TI  - The Upper Respiratory Tract of Felids Is Highly Susceptible to SARS-CoV-2
      Infection.
LID - 10636 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ijms221910636 [doi]
AB  - Natural or experimental infection of domestic cats and virus transmission from
      humans to captive predatory cats suggest that felids are highly susceptible to
      SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, it is unclear which cells and compartments of the 
      respiratory tract are infected. To address this question, primary cell cultures
      derived from the nose, trachea, and lungs of cat and lion were inoculated with
      SARS-CoV-2. Strong viral replication was observed for nasal mucosa explants and
      tracheal air-liquid interface cultures, whereas replication in lung slices was
      less efficient. Infection was mainly restricted to epithelial cells and did not
      cause major pathological changes. Detection of high ACE2 levels in the nose and
      trachea but not lung further suggests that susceptibility of feline tissues to
      SARS-CoV-2 correlates with ACE2 expression. Collectively, this study demonstrates
      that SARS-CoV-2 can efficiently replicate in the feline upper respiratory tract
      ex vivo and thus highlights the risk of SARS-CoV-2 spillover from humans to
      felids.

TI  - Immunomodulation of endothelial cells induced by macrolide therapy in a model of 
      septic stimulation.
PG  - 1656-1669
LID - 10.1002/iid3.518 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Sepsis is defined as the host's inflammatory response to a
      life-threatening infection. The endothelium is implicated in immunoregulation
      during sepsis. Macrolides have been proposed to display immunomodulatory
      properties. The goal of this study was to analyze whether macrolides can exert
      immunomodulation of endothelial cells (ECs) in an experimental model of sepsis.
      METHODS: Human ECs were stimulated by proinflammatory cytokines and
      lipopolysaccharide before exposure to macrolides. ECs phenotypes were analyzed by
      flow cytometry. Cocultures of ECs and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) 
      were performed to study the ECs ability to alter T-cell viability and
      differentiation in the presence of macrolides. Soluble factor production was
      assessed. RESULTS: ECs act as non-professional antigen presenting cells and
      expressed human leukocyte antigen (HLA) antigens, the adhesion molecules CD54,
      CD106, and the coinhibitory molecule CD274 after septic stimulation. Incubation
      with macrolides induced a significant decrease of HLA class I and HLA class II
      HLA-DR on septic-stimulated ECs, but did not alter either CD54, CD106, nor CD274 
      expression. Interleukin-6 (IL-6) and IL-8 production by stimulated ECs were
      unaltered by incubation with macrolides, whereas Clarithromycin exposure
      significantly decreased IL-6 gene expression. In cocultures of septic ECs with
      PBMCs, neither the proportion of CD4 (+ ) , CD8 (+ ) T nor their viability was
      altered by macrolides. T-helper lymphocyte subsets Th1, Th17, and Treg
      polarization by stimulated ECs were unaltered by macrolides. CONCLUSION: This
      study reports phenotypic and gene expression changes in septic-stimulated ECs
      exposed to macrolides, without resulting in altered immunogenicity of ECs in
      co-cultures with PBMCs. In vivo studies may help to further understand the impact
      of macrolide therapy on ECs immune homeostasis during sepsis.

TI  - Day-ahead combined economic and emission dispatch with spinning reserve
      consideration using moth swarm algorithm for a data centre load.

AB  - Dynamic combined economic and emission dispatch is an important task in the power
      system that examines the optimal allocation of power generation resources that
      yield the least possible fuel and emission costs. In this study, the Moth Swarm
      Algorithm has been proposed for solving the combined economic and emission
      dispatch problem for a 24-hour period. The model has been implemented on a test
      system made up of a combination of thermal and solar photovoltaic plants, while
      also considering spinning reserve allocation. The results obtained are presented 
      in comparison with commonly used state-of-the-art methods like Moth Flame
      Optimization, Whale Optimization Algorithm, Ant Lion Optimizer, and Tunicate
      Swarm Algorithm. Two test systems have been considered in the model
      implementation. The first system consists of a combination of six thermal plants 
      and thirteen solar plants whose load demand is the hourly energy demand of an
      anonymous data centre in South Africa. The second test system is made up of three
      thermal plants and thirteen solar plants to service its unique hourly load
      demand. Results showed that the proposed MSA gave preference to solar
      photovoltaic generation over thermal generation given that environmental impact
      minimization is a major component of the overall objective function. The proposed
      MSA also scheduled thermal generators to provide the required spinning reserve
      capacity since solar energy is intermittent in nature. Overall, analyses show
      that the proposed MSA outperformed the other methods in finding the best fuel,
      emission, solar generation, and spinning reserve costs that best serve the energy
      demand of the data centre and the second test system for the 24-hour period.

TI  - Implementation and evaluation of a multivariate abstraction-based, interval-based
      dynamic time-warping method as a similarity measure for longitudinal medical
      records.

LID - S1532-0464(21)00248-3 [pii]

AB  - OBJECTIVES: A common prerequisite for tasks such as classification, prediction,
      clustering and retrieval of longitudinal medical records is a clinically
      meaningful similarity measure that considers both [multiple] variable (concept)
      values and their time. Currently, most similarity measures focus on raw,
      time-stamped data as these are stored in a medical record. However, clinicians
      think in terms of clinically meaningful temporal abstractions, such as
      "decreasing renal functions", enabling them to ignore minor time and value
      variations and focus on similarities among the clinical trajectories of different
      patients. Our objective was to define an abstraction- and interval-based
      methodology for matching longitudinal, multivariate medical records, and
      rigorously assess its value, versus the option of using just the raw,
      time-stamped data. METHODS: We have developed a new methodology for determination
      of the relative distance between a pair of longitudinal records, by extending the
      known dynamic time warping (DTW) method into an interval-based dynamic time
      warping (iDTW) methodology. The iDTW methodology includes (A): A three-steps
      interval-based representation (iRep) method: [1] abstracting the raw,
      time-stamped data of the longitudinal records into clinically meaningful
      interval-based abstractions, using a domain-specific knowledge base, [2] scoping 
      the period of comparison of the records, [3] creating from the intervals a
      symbolic time series, by partitioning them into a predetermined temporal
      granularity; (B) An interval-based matching (iMatch) method to match each
      relevant pair of multivariate longitudinal records, each represented as multiple 
      series of short symbolic intervals in the determined temporal granularity, using 
      a modified DTW version. EVALUATION: Three classification or prediction tasks were
      defined: (1) classifying 161 records of oncology patients as having had
      autologous versus allogenic bone-marrow transplantation; (2) classifying the
      longitudinal records of 125 hepatitis patients as having B or C hepatitis; and
      (3) predicting micro- or macro-albuminuria in the second year, for 151 diabetes
      patients who were followed for five years. The raw, time-stamped, multivariate
      data within each medical record, for one, two, or three concepts out of four or
      five concepts judged as relevant in each medical domain, were abstracted into
      clinically meaningful intervals using the Knowledge-Based Temporal-Abstraction
      method, using previously acquired knowledge. We focused on two
      temporal-abstraction types: (1) State abstractions, which discretize a concept's 
      raw value into a predetermined range (e.g., LOW or HIGH Hemoglobin); and (2)
      Gradient abstractions, which indicate the trend of the concept's value (e.g.,
      INCREASING, DECREASING Hemoglobin value). We created all of the combinations of
      either uni-dimensional (State or Gradient) or multi-dimensional (State and
      Gradient) abstractions, of all of the concepts used. Classification of a record
      was determined by using a majority of the k-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN) of the given 
      record, k ranging over the odd numbers (to break ties) from 1 to N, N being the
      size of the training set. We have experimented with all possible configurations
      of the parameters that our method uses. Overall, a total of 75,936 experiments
      were performed: 33,600 in the Oncology domain, 28,800 in the Hepatitis domain,
      and 13,536 in the Diabetes domain. Each experiment involved the performance of a 
      10-fold Cross Validation to compute the mean performance of a particular iDTW
      method-configuration set of settings, for a specific subset of one, two, or three
      concepts out of all of the domain-specific concepts relevant to the
      classification or prediction task on which the experiment focuses. We measured
      for each such experimental combination the Area Under the Curve (AUC) and the
      optimal Specificity/Sensitivity ratio using Youden's Index. We then aggregated
      the experiments by the types of unidimensional or multidimensional abstractions
      used in them (including the use of only raw concepts as a special case); for
      example, two state abstractions of different concepts, and one gradient
      abstraction of a third concept. We compared the mean AUC when using each such
      feature representation, or combination of abstractions, across all possible
      method-setting configurations, to the mean AUC when using as a feature
      representation, for the same task, only raw concepts, also across all possible
      method-setting configurations. Finally, we applied a paired t-test, to determine 
      whether the mean difference between the accuracy of each temporal-abstraction
      representation, across all concept and configuration combinations, and the
      respective raw-concept combinations, across all concept subset and configuration 
      combinations, is significant (P < 0.05). RESULTS: The mean performance of the
      classification and prediction tasks when using, as a feature representation, the 
      various temporal-abstraction combinations, was significantly higher than that
      performance when using only raw data. Furthermore, in each domain and task, there
      existed at least one representation using interval-based abstractions whose use
      led, on average (over all concept subset combinations and method configurations) 
      to a significantly better performance than the use of only subsets of the raw
      time-stamped data. In seven of nine combinations of domain type (out of three)
      and number of concepts used (one, two, or three), the variance of the AUCs (for
      all representations and configurations) was considerably higher across all
      raw-concept subsets, compared to all abstract combinations. Increasing the number
      of features used by the matching task enhanced performance. Using
      multi-dimensional abstractions of the same concept further enhanced the
      performance. When using only raw data, increasing the number of neighbors
      monotonically increased the mean performance (over all concept combinations and
      method configurations) until reaching an optimal saddle-point aroundN; when using
      abstractions, however, optimal mean performance was often reached after matching 
      only five nearest neighbors. CONCLUSIONS: Using multivariate and multidimensional
      interval-based, abstraction-based similarity measures is feasible, and
      consistently and significantly improved the mean classification and prediction
      performance in time-oriented domains, using DTW-inspired methods, compared to the
      use of only raw, time-stamped data. It also made the KNN classification more
      effective. Nevertheless, although the mean performance for the abstract
      representations was higher than the mean performance when using only raw-data
      concepts, the actual optimal classification performance in each domain and task
      depends on the choice of the specific raw or abstract concepts used as features.

TI  - Telomere shortening causes distinct cell division regimes during replicative
      senescence in Saccharomyces cerevisiae.
PG  - 180
LID - 10.1186/s13578-021-00693-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Telomerase-negative cells have limited proliferation potential. In
      these cells, telomeres shorten until they reach a critical length and induce a
      permanently arrested state. This process called replicative senescence is
      associated with genomic instability and participates in tissue and organismal
      ageing. Experimental data using single-cell approaches in the budding yeast model
      organism show that telomerase-negative cells often experience abnormally long
      cell cycles, which can be followed by cell cycles of normal duration, before
      reaching the terminal senescent state. These series of non-terminal cell cycle
      arrests contribute to the heterogeneity of senescence and likely magnify its
      genomic instability. Due to their apparent stochastic nature, investigating the
      dynamics and the molecular origins of these arrests has been difficult. In
      particular, whether the non-terminal arrests series stem from a mechanism similar
      to the one that triggers terminal senescence is not known. RESULTS: Here, we
      provide a mathematical description of sequences of non-terminal arrests to
      understand how they appear. We take advantage of an experimental data set of cell
      cycle duration measurements performed in individual telomerase-negative yeast
      cells that keep track of the number of generations since telomerase inactivation.
      Using numerical simulations, we show that the occurrence of non-terminal arrests 
      is a generation-dependent process that can be explained by the shortest telomere 
      reaching a probabilistic threshold length. While the onset of senescence is also 
      triggered by telomere shortening, we highlight differences in the laws that
      describe the number of consecutive arrests in non-terminal arrests compared to
      senescence arrests, suggesting distinct underlying mechanisms and cellular
      states. CONCLUSIONS: Replicative senescence is a complex process that affects
      cell divisions earlier than anticipated, as exemplified by the frequent
      occurrence of non-terminal arrests early after telomerase inactivation. The
      present work unravels two kinetically and mechanistically distinct
      generation-dependent processes underlying non-terminal and terminal senescence
      arrests. We suggest that these two processes are responsible for two consequences
      of senescence at the population level, the increase of genome instability on the 
      one hand, and the limitation of proliferation capacity on the other hand.

TI  - Modified procedure for Loading "Flat" DMEK Grafts Into an Injector.
PG  - 379-384
LID - 10.1097/ICO.0000000000002870 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: The aim of this study was to determine whether loading a Descemet
      membrane endothelial keratoplasty (DMEK) graft using a drop-in procedure results 
      in more endothelial cell loss (ECL) than the standard suction procedure. METHODS:
      Pairs of donor corneas with equivalent preprocessing endothelium were prepared
      using the standard protocol of our eye bank. One member of each pair was loaded
      into an injector using the standard suction protocol. The mate graft was loaded
      using a drop-in protocol, in which the edge of the graft was gently grasped with 
      a forceps, lifted to the edge of the injector, and dropped inside. Grafts were
      evaluated for ECL and examined for grab marks or other loading-associated damage.
      RESULTS: There was no difference in mean ECL of grafts prepared for DMEK using
      the standard protocol (20.6% +/- 4.5%) compared with that of mate grafts prepared
      using the drop-in loading protocol (19.5% +/- 4.8%, P = 0.59). There was no
      consistent pattern of damage in the drop-in-loaded grafts, as grab marks or other
      tissue damage associated with the drop-in loading protocol were not consistently 
      identified by a trained corneal surgeon. CONCLUSIONS: ECL was not significantly
      different in grafts prepared using a drop-in loading procedure compared with
      grafts prepared using the standard suction protocol. The drop-in loading protocol
      may be particularly useful to surgeons who load their own grafts and eye bank
      processing technicians who encounter a "flat" DMEK graft that does not scroll or 
      a loosely scrolled DMEK graft.

      preparation time in both healthy and diabetic (high-risk) donor eyes. METHODS:
      Twenty nondiabetic and 10 diabetic donor corneas were processed using DescePrep, 
      which standardizes the liquid bubble technique. Corneas were stained with trypan 
      blue and then processed. Cell counts through specular microscopy, optical
      coherence tomography imaging, and slit-lamp analysis were used for the evaluation
      of graft separation and viability in 5 nondiabetic corneas. The remaining 25
      corneas (15 nondiabetic and 10 diabetic) were evaluated for preparation success
      rate and processing time. Ten corneas (5 nondiabetic and 5 diabetic) were
      randomly selected for further evaluation of global cell loss through staining.
      RESULTS: Ninety-seven percent of corneas (29 of 30) were prepared successfully
      with DescePrep. The average preparation time was 2.83 +/- 1.8 minutes. There was 
      no significant difference in the time of preparation between the nondiabetic and 
      diabetic groups (P = 0.077). The overall average cell death after processing was 
      7.9% +/- 3.7% for all corneas. There was no significant difference in cell
      viability between diabetic and nondiabetic tissues after DescePrep processing (P 
      = 0.769). CONCLUSIONS: DescePrep is a new DMEK preparation technique that can
      process both nondiabetic and diabetic donor corneas at high yields in minutes.
      High-yield preparation of diabetic corneas may offer eye banks access to a larger
      donor pool, which is important because the demand for DMEK grafts continues to
      rise worldwide.

TI  - The mitochondrial genome and Epigenome of the Golden lion Tamarin from fecal DNA 
      using Nanopore adaptive sequencing.

LID - 10.1186/s12864-021-08046-7 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The golden lion tamarin (Leontopithecus rosalia) is an endangered
      Platyrrhine primate endemic to the Atlantic coastal forests of Brazil. Despite
      ongoing conservation efforts, genetic data on this species remains scarce.
      Complicating factors include limitations on sample collection and a lack of
      high-quality reference sequences. Here, we used nanopore adaptive sampling to
      resequence the L. rosalia mitogenome from feces, a sample which can be collected 
      non-invasively. RESULTS: Adaptive sampling doubled the fraction of both
      host-derived and mitochondrial sequences compared to sequencing without
      enrichment. 258x coverage of the L. rosalia mitogenome was achieved in a single
      flow cell by targeting the unfinished genome of the distantly related emperor
      tamarin (Saguinus imperator) and the mitogenome of the closely related black lion
      tamarin (Leontopithecus chrysopygus). The L. rosalia mitogenome has a length of
      16,597 bp, sharing 99.68% sequence identity with the L. chrysopygus mitogenome. A
      total of 38 SNPs between them were identified, with the majority being found in
      the non-coding D-loop region. DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation were
      directly detected using a neural network model applied to the raw signal from the
      MinION sequencer. In contrast to prior reports, DNA methylation was negligible in
      mitochondria in both CpG and non-CpG contexts. Surprisingly, a quarter of the 642
      CpG sites exhibited DNA hydroxymethylation greater than 1% and 44 sites were
      above 5%, with concentration in the 3' side of several coding regions.
      CONCLUSIONS: Overall, we report a robust new mitogenome assembly for L. rosalia
      and direct detection of cytosine base modifications in all contexts.

      petals of scented roses.

AB  - Climate change and the consequent alteration in agricultural circumstances
      enhance the susceptibility of fresh water use particularly in water-scarce
      regions. Marginal quality water reuse is a common alternative practice but
      possible perils of metal accretion in plant parts are mostly ignored. The present
      research aimed to probe the impact of treated wastewater (TWW) and untreated
      wastewater (UTWW) on metal accumulation in flower petals and their influence on
      essential oil contents of fragrant Rosa species (R. Gruss-an-teplitz, R.
      bourboniana, R. centifolia, R. damascena) in a peri-urban area of Faisalabad,
      Pakistan during January, 2017 to December, 2018. The mineral and chemical
      contents in canal water (CW) and TWW were less than recommended levels of
      national environmental quality standards (NEQS) for wastewater of Pakistan. The
      experimentally UTWW possessed higher electrical conductivity (EC), biological and
      chemical oxygen demand (BOD and COD), and some metals (Pb, Co, Cr) that were
      above the permissible levels. The experimental data revealed that except Cr other
      metals contents in the flower petals were less than the WHO recommended limits
      (for medicinal plants) under experimental irrigation regimes. Rosa centifolia and
      R. damascena possessed higher metal i.e. Zn, Cu, Pb, Cr, Co contents while Fe and
      Ni contents were higher in R. Gruss-an-Teplitz and R. bourboniana respectively.
      There were twelve constituents which were detected in essential oil by gas
      chromatography. Major constituents were phenyl ethyl alcohol, citronellol,
      geranyl acetate, gamma- undelactone, methyl eugenol, and limonene whose share was
      48.17%, 41.11%, 8.46%, 4.82%, 4.44%, and 4.15% respectively whereas
      concentrations of other 06 constituents were less than 3.7%. Phenyl ethyl
      alcohol, lion shared constituent of essential oil was found highest (48.17%) in
      R. Gruss-an-Teplitz whereas minimum level was recorded in R. damascena (28.84%)
      under CW. In contrast, citronellol (chief component of fragrance) was highest in 
      R. damascena (41.11%) in UTWW while the lowest level was found in R.
      Gruss-an-Teplitz (17.41%) in CW. This study confirmed the variations in metal
      concentrations of Rosa species due to different absorbability of each metal in
      flower petals. It also indicates that wastewater did not affect the composition
      but there were quantitative differences in aroma constituents and chemical
      composition of essential oil.

AB  - Biallelic mutations in the RCBTB1 gene cause retinal dystrophy. Here, we
      characterized the effects of RCBTB1 gene deficiency in retinal pigment epithelial
      (RPE) cells derived from a patient with RCBTB1-associated retinopathy and
      restored RCBTB1 expression in these cells using adeno-associated viral (AAV)
      vectors. Induced pluripotent stem cells derived from a patient with compound
      heterozygous RCBTB1 mutations (c.170delG and c.707delA) and healthy control
      subjects were differentiated into RPE cells. RPE cells were treated with AAV
      vectors carrying a RCBTB1 transgene. Patient-derived RPE cells showed reduced
      expression of RCBTB1. Expression of NFE2L2 showed a non-significant reduction in 
      patient RPE cells compared with controls, while expression of its target genes
      (RXRA, IDH1 and SLC25A25) was significantly reduced. Trans-epithelial electrical 
      resistance, surface microvillus densities and primary cilium lengths were reduced
      in patient-derived RPE cells, compared with controls. Treatment of patient RPE
      with AAV vectors significantly increased RCBTB1, NFE2L2 and RXRA expression and
      cilium lengths. Our study provides the first report examining the phenotype of
      RPE cells derived from a patient with RCBTB1-associated retinopathy. Furthermore,
      treatment of patient-derived RPE with AAV-RCBTB1 vectors corrected deficits in
      gene expression and RPE ultrastructure, supporting the use of gene replacement
      therapy for treating this inherited retinal disease.

      movements with their whiskers. California sea lions (Zalophus californianus) make
      large, purposeful whisker movements and are capable of performing many
      whisker-related discrimination tasks. Therefore, California sea lions are an
      ideal species to explore the active nature of whisker touch sensing. Here, we
      show that California sea lions can make task-specific whisker movements.
      California sea lions move their whiskers with large amplitudes around object
      edges to judge size, make smaller, lateral stroking movements to judge texture
      and make very small whisker movements during a visual task. These findings,
      combined with the ease of training mammals and measuring whisker movements, makes
      whiskers an ideal system for studying mammalian perception, cognition and motor
      control.
